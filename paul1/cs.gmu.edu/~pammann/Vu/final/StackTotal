// Overall questions for StackInClass.java

1) Write a total contract for push()

2) What is wrong with toString()?  Fix it

3) What is a good rep-invariant for this version of the Stack class?

4) Is pop() correct?  Be sure to explain your reasoning.

5) As written, pushAll() violates Bloch's guidance on exception handling.  Why?  Fix it.

6) As written, pushAll() requires documentation that violates encapsulation.  Why?  

7) Rewrite the pop() method for an immutable version of this class.

8) The equals() method for this class is a messy exercise, but would
	be much easier if the array was replaced by a list.  Explain why.

9) Write a reasonable implementation of clone()  (Don't worry about syntax; "exam" java is fine.)
