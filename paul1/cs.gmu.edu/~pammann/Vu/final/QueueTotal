// Overall questions for Queue.java

1) Write a reasonable toString() implementation.

2) Write a total contract for deQueue()

3) What is a good rep-invariant for the Queue class?

4) Is deQueue() correct?  Be sure to explain your reasoning.

5) Consider a new method, deQueueAll(), which does exactly 
what the name suggests.
Write a reasonable contract for this method
and then implement it.  Be sure to follow Bloch's advice with
respect to generics.

6) Rewrite the deQueue() method for an immutable version of this class.

7) Override hashCode() and equals() for the Queue class.  Hint:  This is
   very simple code.

8) Write a reasonable implementation of clone()  (Don't worry about syntax; "exam" java is fine.)
