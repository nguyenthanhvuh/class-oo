Consider {\tt Queue.java}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Write a reasonable {\tt toString()} implementation.

\item
Consider a new method, {\tt deQueueAll()}, which does exactly 
what the name suggests.
Write a reasonable contract for this method
and then implement it.  Be sure to follow Bloch's advice with
respect to generics.

\item
Rewrite the {\tt deQueue()} method for an immutable version of this class.

\item
Write a reasonable implementation of {\tt clone()}.  
Note: Don't worry about Java syntax; "exam" Java is fine.

\end{enumerate}
