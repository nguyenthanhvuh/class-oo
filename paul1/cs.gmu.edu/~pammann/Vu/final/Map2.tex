Consider {\tt MapPoly.java}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Bloch would not accept that the {\tt MapPoly} class 
is immutable.
Why not?  
Show how it would be possible to provide mutable behavior
with the class if Bloch's problem isn't fixed.
Fix the problem.
\item
Consider implementing  {\tt Cloneable} for this class.
Decide whether Bloch would think this is a good idea
and provide justification for your answer.
Note:  You don't have to actually implement anything for this question.
\item
Provide reasonable implementations of {\tt equals()} and {\tt hashCode()}.
Explain why you believe your implemetations are appropriate.
\end{enumerate}
