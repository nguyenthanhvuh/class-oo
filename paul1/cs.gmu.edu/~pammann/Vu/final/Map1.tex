Consider {\tt MapPoly.java}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a reasonable rep-invariant  for {\tt MapPoly}.
\item As written, the contract for the {\tt coeff()} method
is inconsistent with other contracts in the class.
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the inconsistency with the contract?
\item Fix the inconsistency with the contract.
\item Fix the code to match the revised contract.
\end{itemize}
\item Argue that the implementation of the {\tt coeff()} method is correct
(with respect to your repaired contract, of course.)
\end{enumerate}
