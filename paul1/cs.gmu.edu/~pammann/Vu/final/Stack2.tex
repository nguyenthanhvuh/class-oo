Consider {\tt StackInClass.java}.
You should take special note of the {\tt push()} method;
it is a variation on Bloch's code.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
What is wrong with {\tt toString()}?  Fix it.

\item
As written, {\tt pushAll()} requires documentation that violates encapsulation.  Explain why
and then write a contract for {\tt pushAll()}.

\item
Rewrite the {\tt pop()} method for an immutable version of the {\tt Stack} class.
Keep the same instance variables.

\item
Implementing the {\tt equals()} method for this class is a messy exercise, but would
	be much easier if the array was replaced by a list.  Explain why.
	Note:  You are not required to provide a implementation in your answer,
	but if you find it helpful to do so, that's fine.
\end{enumerate}
