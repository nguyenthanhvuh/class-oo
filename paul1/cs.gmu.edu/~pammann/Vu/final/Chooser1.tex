Consider Bloch's final version of his {\tt Chooser} example, namely {\tt GenericChooser.java}.


\begin{enumerate}
\item
What would be a good good representation invariant for this class?
You may want to argue that the client
view of {\tt Chooser} objects  should be changed to support 
your proposed invariant.
If so, explain exactly what you are doing and why.
\item
Supply suitable contracts for the constructor and the {\tt choose()} method
and recode if necessary.
The contracts should be consistent with your answer to the previous question.
Explain exactly what you are doing and why.
\item
Argue that the {\tt choose()} method, as documented and possibly updated
in your previous answers, is correct.  
You don't have to be especially formal, but you do have
to ask (and answer) the right questions.  
\end{enumerate}
