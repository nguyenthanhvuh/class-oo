Consider {\tt StackInClass.java}.
You should take special note of the {\tt push()} method;
it is a variation on Bloch's code.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Write a total contract for {\tt push() }

\item
What is a good rep-invariant for this version of the {\tt Stack} class?

\item
Is {\tt pop()} correct?  Be sure to explain your reasoning.

\item
As written, {\tt pushAll()} violates Bloch's guidance on exception handling.  Why?  Fix it.

\item
Write a reasonable implementation of {\tt clone()}.  
Note: Don't worry about Java syntax; "exam" Java is fine.
\end{enumerate}
