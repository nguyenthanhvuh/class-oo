Consider {\tt Queue.java}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Write a total contract for deQueue()

\item
What is a good rep-invariant for the Queue class?

\item
Is deQueue() correct?  Be sure to explain your reasoning.

\item
Override hashCode() and equals() for the Queue class.  
Note: This is very simple code.

\end{enumerate}
