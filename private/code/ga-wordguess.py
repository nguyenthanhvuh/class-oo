TARGET = '''
The 2012 Aston Martin Vanquish was the second generation of the Vanquish, a grand touring car. It was produced between 2012 and 2018 by the British carmaker Aston Martin. It succeeded the DBS, resurrected the name of the 2001â€“2007 model, and was available as both a coupe and a convertible, the latter known as the Volante. The Vanquish, which is based upon the DB9's architecture, extensively incorporates aluminium throughout its construction. The Vanquish was designed by Marek Reichman and showcased at several events in 2012. It was produced in Gaydon, a village in Warwickshire, England. Aston Martin unveiled the Vanquish Volante in August 2013 and began deliveries late that year. In 2014, they implemented minor modifications to the Vanquish's engine performance. A significantly modified version, the Vanquish S, was launched in 2016; its Volante version was released the following year. The Vanquish S introduced such updates as increased horsepower and torque, and a new body kit.
