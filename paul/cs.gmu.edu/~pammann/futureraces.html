<H1>Fall 2015 Schedule</H1>

<p>

After yet another injury recovery, this time apparently from alignment issues,
I'm once again trying to crank the mileage back up.
Back in August when I signed up for Stone Mill, I wasn't running at all.
We'll see how that works out.
I'm pretty sure I'm going to suffer.
A lot.
<p>
I'm also signed up for Marine Corps.  If my brother makes
it into town, we'll jog it together.  
(I'm done running marathons hard.)
It will make a nice training run for Stone Mill.
If he doesn't, I'll train on something softer.

<!--
I missed the cut for
<A HREF=http://www.jfk50mile.org>JFK</A>.
I have mixed feelings about that.
JFK was my first ultra, and I have 8 finishes in the bag,
all under 10 hours,
so I wanted to run it.
OTOH, the entry fee is ridiculous.
It was $45 back in 1999 when I first signed up;
now it's 
<A HREF="http://www.usdebtclock.org/">a lot more</A>.
I don't know why - the race seems pretty much the same.

August 22:
<A HREF=http://www.pabikeracing.com/SouthMountain.html>
South Mountain Hill Climb</A>. <BR>
Features:   Very short for a bike race: only 7 1/2 miles total. 
	But 5 of them go straight up. 1300 feet vertical.
<BR>
Plan:	Keep pedaling.
<BR>
Goal:	Enjoy Matt at his first road race.
<BR>
Result:  Matt: 27:55 (4/12). me: 31:42 (8/12).
Matt attacked a bit too early;
it turned out some of the other guys weren't really suffering that much.
To no one's surprise,
I went straight out the back when the road tilted up at mile 2.
The ride back down was a lot easier.

October 4:
<A HREF=http://www.bluescruiseultra.com>
Blues Cruise 50k</A>. <BR>
Features:   My nephew Drew.  My first ultra in nearly a year.
<BR>
Plan:	No plan really.  Just one foot in front of the other.
<BR>
Goal:	Finish without physical damage - especially foot damage.
<BR>
Result:  Drew: 5:13:08 (35/140). me: 5:49:11 (67/140).
Good weather: very dry and not too warm.
Nice trail, although loaded with black walnuts and poison ivy.
Drew and I ran together until the
aid station at mile 21,
where he took off while I had a beer.
Drew ran hard the last 10 miles.
Obviously, I didn't.
My foot was fine.
I'm very happy to be back.

<A HREF=http://stone-mill-50-mile.org>
Stone Mill 50 Miler</A>. <BR>
Features:   Seneca Creek Trail.  
<BR>
Plan:	Try to stay upright and on course.
<BR>
Goal:   Considering my lack of training, I'll be happy to finish.
<BR>
<!--
Result: 11:50:46 (95/180).
We certainly got our bonus miles - 4 to 6 according
to the GPS-ers.  Ouch!
It was my first time running 
"on the bubble",
since the official cut-off was 12 hours.
Next year I hope they cut out the extra miles.
There just isn't enough daylight at this time of year.
<br>
My lack of distance training was very apparent.
I also had trouble staying upright with the assorted roots and rocks.
But I finished in one piece, and I'm totally happy with that.
<br>
The event itself is fantastic - well organized and well marked.
Many thanks to the volunteers who made it possible for us
runners to spend the day goofing around in the woods.
<br>
Finally, running through a park that's open for
bow hunters going after deer is more than a little disconcerting.
A good day to wear bright colors.
A bad day to wear the antler hat.

<A HREF= http://www.vhtrc.org/events/pot-h50.htm>
Potomac Heritage 50k</A>. <BR>
Features:   Total goofiness on the surprisingly rugged Potomac River inside the Beltway.
<BR>
Plan: Plan?  What plan?  Show up and start running.
<BR>
Goal: Pure enjoyment.   
<BR>
Result:  DNS.
I concluded that a 50k a week off Marine Corps 
amounted to injury risk
with minimal possible training benefit.
So, I bagged it.
That's the new me, worrying
about running too much.

December ?:
<A HREF= http://www.vhtrc.org/events/fa50.htm>
Magnus Gluteus Maximus 50k</A>. <BR>
Features:   Total goofiness on the Bull Run Trail.
Probably, Gary will bring along some special beverages.
<BR>
Plan: Show up and start running.
<BR>
Goal: Have fun.   
<BR>

November 22:
<A HREF=http://www.jfk50mile.org>
JFK 50 Miler</A>. <BR>
Features:   Appalachian Trail and C&O Canal Towpath.  A ballooning entrance fee :-(
<BR>
Plan: Slow and careful on the AT,
preferably choking down some serious calories.
After that, it's just survival.  <BR>
Goal: 
Over the course of 8 JFK finishes,
I've managed
to run within a remarkably narrow half hour window just inside 10 hours.
Not fast, certainly.
But respectable in a middle-of-the-pack kind of way.
I'd like to extend that streak,
ideally with only a modest amount of suffering.
Maybe, one day, I'll figure out how to train to improve on it.
But that won't happen this year.
I'm acutely aware that I have missed 
that window by hours in comparable events.
<br>
Result: 
DNS.  The right foot diagnosis is definitive; stress fracture of 3rd metatarsal.
As it turns out, running a 20 miler <i>after</i> the
fracture is a really bad thing to do.
Who knew?
<br>
It will be January, perhaps later, before the doc blesses my return to the trails.
Meantime, it's biking, weightlifting, and the elliptical.
