   Principles of user interface design.
   Concepts for objectively and quantitatively assessing the usability of software user interfaces.
   Outcomes include knowledge of quantitative engineering principles for
   designing usable software interfaces and an understanding that usability is more important than efficiency
   for almost all modern software projects, and often the primary factor that leads to product success.
   Major topics include cognitive models for human perceptions and needs,
   which are used as a basis for analytical and critical thinking about user interfaces;
   specific engineering principles for designing usable
   menus, forms, command languages, web sites, graphical user interfaces and web-based user interfaces.
   Assessments will include written analytical evaluations of existing user interfaces,
   exams, and HTML-based design projects.

<p>
<dt>LEARNING OUTCOMES
<dd>
<div align="justify">
  <ol>
    <li>Knowledge of quantitative engineering principles for how to build
        software interfaces that are usable.
    <li>Understanding that usability is more important than efficiency for
        almost all modern software projects,
        and often the primary factor that leads to product success.
    <li>The ability to critically analyze existing user interfaces and
        express their positive and negative aspects in engineering terms,

<p>
<dt>CONTENT & STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES
<dd>

<div align="justify">
   After completing this course,
   students should understand how to design and evaluate software interfaces
   that are <i>appropriate</i> for the user.
   The class will rely on critical thinking to understand what makes a computer UI usable.
   We will look at many example UIs and discuss
   what they do right and what they do wrong.
   SWE 205 will <b>not require programming</b>.

<dt>GRADING
<dd>
          <ul>
            <li>Group Functioning: 5% </li>
            <li>Reading Reflections (group-based): 10% </li>
            <li>Homework assignments (group-based): 20%</li>
            <li>Homework presentations (both group and individual): 20%</li>
            <li>Class attendance: 10%</li>  
            <li>Project (group-based): 35%</li>
          </ul>

<p>
<dt>GROUP FUNCTIONING
<dd>
<div align="justify">
<p>
Every student needs to be part of a group. I would prefer that groups stay stable throughout the semester, but if there is a good rationale to reconfigure a group or two, we'll do that.
Group size: 2-4 students.  


<p>
Group creation mechanism: As a default, we'll drop students into groups at random. If you are happy with your random group, great! If you prefer a different group, during the first week you will have the option to re-group. If your group dwindles to two students, you'll both need to join another group.

<p>
At the end of the semester, each student will provide an assessment 
the promptness, reliability, and engagement of other
students in their group.   Students will <b>not</b> assess competence;
this is about showing up, doing your share of the work, and being a good citizen.  
<p>
This assessment will determine the "Group Functioning" part of the grade.
Generally, this works out to full credit for the majority of students.  
But for students who are MIA, this works out to zero credit.  
Occasionally, there are a few "partial credit" students.  Please don't
do that to your group.

<p>
Groups can communicate internally through any mechanism they choose: zoom, discord, google docs, whatever.

<p>
<dt>READINGS REFLECTIONS
<dd>
<div align="justify">
   Readings are on the schedule web page.  
   Most readings are fairly short.
   Sometimes the reading is a chapter in a required text (e.g. "Ko Chapter 2").
   Sometimes the reading is a webpage (e.g. "Schneiderman's 8 Rules").
   Either way, I expect you to read the relevant material <em>before</em> class;
   that way you are ready for class.
   Specifically, this means reading the actual text, and not just surfing the slides, should
   there happen to be slides for that particular reading assignment.
   To help you do the readings on time,
   your <em>group</em> will complete weekly <em>reading reflections</em> on BB.
<p>
Notes:
<UL>
	<LI> Since I use the reading reflections to prepare for (the Tuesday) class,
	reading reflections are due <b>Mondays at midnight</b>.
	<LI> The reflections are <b>not</b> assessments.  You are <b>not</b> expected
	to have mastered the material. You are expected to have reviewed the material
	and reflected on it within your group.
	Hence, these are not graded as assessments.
	<LI> There are no make-ups.
	<LI> Please!  Only one submission per group.  
	<LI> Everyone in the group (who participated) gets the same credit.
	<LI> This mechanism has worked really well in other classes,
	and I expect that it will be an important part of this class.
</UL>

<p>
<dt>CLASS ATTENDANCE
<dd>
<div align="justify">
   I place great emphasis on in-class learning in all of my classes.
   <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/~pammann/teaching/interactive.html">
   Here's why.</a>
   For this particular course, in-class learning is even more important.
	In the online setting, class is synchronous, so attendance means
	being on live on BB during the class session.
<P>
           Hence, I expect students to be in (the virtual) class.  
	To enforce this, the GTA will capture BB attendance
	   and I will factor it into your final grade.  
<p>
	Here's the algorithm:  we have 28
	   scheduled meetings.  The first 21 meetings you attend don't earn any credit.   
	  After
	   that, each class attended earns 20% of the attendance grade.  
	If you work this
	   out, you'll discover that you can miss two classes and still earn full credit.
<p>
	I understand that there are occasionally technical difficulties 
	in zoom/BB land.  If this impacts your attendance on a particular
	day, it is your responsibility to communicate that fact to the GTA as promptly
	as possible.  We'll consider your circumstances and <b>may</b> grant exceptions.
	Don't expect a lot of this.
<p>
           For the vast majority of students, this policy works fine.  In exceptional
           circumstances, it doesn't.   If necessary, contact me for a discussion.


<p>
<dt>HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS
<dd>
<div align="justify">
   We will have assignments every week.
   Generally these require a short written report.
   For credit, you must share homework solutions with the class via public posting on Piazza.
   Homework solutions must be submitted before class on the day they are due to be counted as on time.
   To keep Piazza navigation reasonable, homeworks should all appear under the same thread in Piazza 
   (e.g. "Assignment 4 Solutions").
   Failure to do so will earn a smarty-pants rebuke and a deduction in marks on the assignment.
<P>
   For each assignment, some groups (possibly volunteers; otherwise chosen at random)
   will present their solutions.  We'll cycle through groups; everyone will have multiple
   chances to present homework solutions.  Because of the nature of the assignments,
   it's unlikely that any two solutions will be exactly the same.
<p>
   Presentations should last just a few minutes.  I discourage slide decks and videos for these presentations,
   but you will often find it helpful to display images.  You can simply put these on Piazza with your report
   and display them if called upon.
<p>
Important:  Everyone in the group should participate in the presentation.
I'm specifically looking for statements connecting principles discussed in
class to specific details in the homework.
You can program these into your presentation, or you can have me prompt you for them
during the presentation.
</div>

<p>
<dt>COLLABORATION
<dd>
<div align="justify">
   You are <em>encouraged</em> to work on the assignments collaboratively
	both within your group and across groups (e.g. through Piazza).
<p>
	Assignments are generally open-ended enough that there is no
	reason for assignments to be super similar.
</div>

<p>
<dt>PROJECT
<dd>
<div align="justify">
   The course project explores creating and evaluating alternate designs for a specific interface.
   Details will be provided later in the semester, but the project
   will be a gropu project.
   The project will be due in three separate milestones.
</div>

<p>
<dt>PIAZZA
<dd>
<div align="justify">

<P>
          I find anonymous discussions unhelpful in this class;
          here learning is predicated on interactions.   
  	  Plus, part of your education
          is to learn to stand behind your questions and ideas.  That's how employees
          function in the working world.   Piazza allows
          partial, but not complete, control of anonymous posts.
          Should someone post anonymously, I will ask the poster to change the visibility
          and ask the class not to respond to the anonymous version.






<p>
<dt>IN-CLASS EXERCISES
<dd>
<div align="justify">
   Most classes will feature in-class exercises .
   Some will involve writing and
   some will involve modest problem solving.
   Some will be based on the day's reading
   and some will be based on a previous class meeting.
</div>

<p>
<dt>LATE/MAKEUP STUFF
<dd>
<div align="justify">
   Late homework submissions lose 20% per week.  I want you staying on track.

   </UL>
</div>

<p>
<dt><b>OFFICE HOURS</b>
<dd>
<div align="justify">
   <em>Office hours</em> are times that I commit to being in my office,
   (virtual) door open,
   first come, first served.
   You do not need an appointment,
   and no appointments are made.
   If you cannot make my office hours, then we can try to set up an appointment.
   I will post a note on Piazza if I have to miss office hours.
</div>
