  Express the following in CTL.
  Use the following declaration in constructing your answer.
  Specifically, the variable <code>class</code> can have exactly
  one of the given values at any one time.
<pre>
  VAR
     class  : {start, quiz, lecture, exercise, break, end};
</pre>
<OL>
<LI>
        As soon as class <code>start</code>s,
	a <code>quiz</code> is always next.
<br> <br> <br>
<br> <br> <br>
<br><b>Answer:</b>    
<pre>
    class=start -&gt; AX (class=quiz)
</pre>
<LI>
        If there is a  <code>quiz</code>,
	then later there is a <code>break</code>.
<br> <br> <br>
<br> <br> <br>
<br><b>Answer:</b>    
<pre>
    class=quiz -&gt; AF(class=break)
</pre>
<LI>
	After a <code>break</code>
        there is a  never a <code>quiz</code>.
<br> <br> <br>
<br> <br> <br>
<br><b>Answer:</b>    
<pre>
    class=break -> AG (class!=quiz)
</pre>
Note, you could put an explicit delay in here (with an AX) to
address the word "After", but, given that there is only one
variable (ie "class"), and it can only have one value at any
given time, there is no need to do so.
<LI>
	If the <code>quiz</code> is ongoing in the current state, but over in some next state,
        then it is over in all next states.
<br> <br> <br>
<br> <br> <br>
<br><b>Answer:</b>    
<pre>
    class=quiz && [EX class!=quiz] -> AX [class!=quiz]
</pre>
<LI>
	Once we get to the  <code>end</code> of class
        we don't do anything else.
<br> <br> <br>
<br> <br> <br>
<br><b>Answer:</b>    
<pre>
    class=end -> AG (class=end)
</pre>
If you think the word "Once" implies that we are guaranteed to
get to the end of class, you could add this constraint as well:
<pre>
    AF( class = end)
    &
    class=end -> AG (class=end)
</pre>
</OL>
