Type abstraction is the focus of Quiz 6.
In addition to the basic Java mechanisms
for implementing type abstraction,
you should understand section 7.9,
particularly the "signature" rule,
the role of preconditions and postconditions
in the "methods" rule,
and simple applications of the "properties" rule.
You should be prepared to analyze example
specifications for overridden methods.
