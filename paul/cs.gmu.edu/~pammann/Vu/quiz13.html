Consider the "int enum pattern", a throwback to C, vs.
Java enums.
<pre>
// int enum pattern (in Java)
public static final int APPLE_FUJI         = 0;
public static final int APPLE_PIPPIN       = 1;

public static final int ORANGE_NAVEL       = 0;
public static final int ORANGE_TEMPLE      = 1;

vs.

// Java enum - basic version
public enum Apple  { FUJI, PIPPIN };
public enum Orange { NAVEL, TEMPLE };
</pre>

Bloch identifies various problems with the first pattern.
Identify 3 of these reasons.
<UL>
<LI> <br>  <br>
<LI> <br>  <br>
<LI> <br> <br>
</UL>


<br> <b>Answer</b>
<UL>
<LI>  The int enum pattern is not type safe.
This means that comparing apples to oranges:
<pre>
(APPLE_FUJI == ORANGE_TEMPLE)
</pre>
is meaningless,
but compiles and runs.
On the other hand, the expression:
<pre>
(FUJI == TEMPLE)
</pre>
won't compile.
<LI>
The name spaces for enums are distinct,
hence you are stuck with
APPLE_FUJI in the int enum pattern, 
instead of the more convenient FUJI.
<LI>
The int enum pattern is brittle.
Since integer constants are compiled in,
changing a constant requires recompiling clients,
which is basically unrealistic in real-world programs.
On the other hand, Java enums are objects,
so dynamic dispatching yields the correct behavior
without client recompilation.
<LI>
There is no easy way to obtain Strings from
the int enum pattern, but Java enums provide
a sensible default behavior in toString().
<LI>
There is no way to determine, at run time,
how many enums are in an int enum pattern,
but this information is easily available in Java enums.
</UL>
Grading note:  Variations of these answers are acceptable for grading,
as are answers that reference the added expressive power of Java enums.
Only the reason is required; explanations are not.

<!--
<LI>  Why does Bloch object to the following enum?
<pre>
public enum Ensemble {
    SOLO, DUET, TRIO, QUARTET, QUINTET,
    SEXTET, SEPTET, OCTET, NONET, DECTET;

    public int numberOfMusicians() { return ordinal() + 1; }
}
</pre>
<br>
<br> <b>Answer</b>
Bloch advocates the use of instance fields instead of ordinals.
Ordinal use is brittle, and cannot withstand gaps, duplicates, or re-ordering of enums.
<LI>
Is <code>EnumSet</code> a subtype of <code>Set</code>?
In other words, does <code>EnumSet</code>
satisfy the "is a" relation with respect to the <code>Set</code> interface?
<br> <br>
<br> <b>Answer</b>
Yes.

<LI>
In Item 35 (Prefer annotiations to naming patterns),
Bloch identifies three significant disadvantages of
naming patterns.
List two of these:
<UL>
<LI> <br>  <br>
<LI> <br>  <br>
</UL>
<br> <b>Answer</b>
<UL>
<LI> Typographical errors in naming patterns result in silent failures.
<LI> There is no way to ensure that naming patterns are assoiated
	with the appropriate program element.
<LI> Naming patterns do not provide a mechanism to
	associate parameter values with program elements.
</UL>

</OL>
