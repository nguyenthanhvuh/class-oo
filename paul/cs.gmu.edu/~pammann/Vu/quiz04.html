   The rep-invariant for Liskov's Poly class (as implemented in the text) is:
<pre>
      private int deg;
      private int[] trms; 

      1) trms != null &&
      2) trms.length >= 1 &&
      3) deg = trms.length-1 &&
      4) if deg > 0 then trms[deg] !=0 
</pre>
   Suppose that we weaken the rep-invariant be deleting the 4th constraint.
   Note that there is no effect on the abstraction function.
<OL>
<LI>
	Consider the Poly 5 + 4x^2.
<br>
	Give example values for <code>deg</code> and <code>trms</code>
	that satisfy the new invariant, but not the old one.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Answer</b>:
Basically, you need a trailing zero.
Here are two possibilities.
<pre>
   deg = 3, trms = [5,0,4,0]
   deg = 4, trms = [5,0,4,0,0]
</pre>
<LI>
	The <code>degree</code> method, as written, is not correct under the weaker rep-invariant.
<pre>
public int degree() {
   // Effects:  Returns the degree of this, ie the largest exponent
   //    with a non-zero coefficient.  Returns 0 if this is the zero Poly.
   return deg; 
}
</pre>
Step through the analysis:
<UL>
	<LI> Does <code>degree()</code> maintain the weaker rep-invariant?
	If not, what's the problem?
<br> <br> <br> <br>
	<LI> Does <code>degree()</code> satisfy its contract? 
	If not, what's the problem?  (Note:  Depending on the answer to the previous question,
	no analysis may be required here.)
</UL>
<br> <br> <br> <br>
<b>Answer</b>:
<code>degree()</code> definitely maintains the rep-invariant.
It doesn't modify any variables!
But it doesn't satisfy its contract.
The problem is that the contract asks for the degree,
but deg might be associated with a zero coefficient.
<LI>
	Rewrite <code>degree()</code>
	so that it is correct under the weaker rep-invariant
	("Quiz" Java is fine.)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Answer</b>:
The necessary code searches for the highest non-zero coefficient in the 
<code>trms</code> array and return the corresponding index.
<pre>
   for (int i = deg; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (trms[i] != 0) return i;
   }
   return 0;
</pre>
Grading note:  I'm unconcerned about Java syntax or minor errors;
if it's clear from your code what your intent is, you'll receive credit.
