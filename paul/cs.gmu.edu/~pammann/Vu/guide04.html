Abstraction functions, rep-invariants, and verification are the focus
of Quiz 4.
You should understand, evaluate, and modify the abstraction functions and
rep-invariants for simple variations on examples we have discussed in class.
You should also understand the verification of methods
with respect to their specifications.
If I give you a specification, and a Java implementation,
you should be able to analyze (informally) whether the method is correct.
In particular, I'd suggest studying the verification of the
Members example, which we covered in the in-class exercise.
