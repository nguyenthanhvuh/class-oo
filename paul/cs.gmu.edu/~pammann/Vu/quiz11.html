Consider the following code,
and suppose the main method in <code>Sub</code> is
executed.
<pre>
public class Super {
  private String y;
  public Super () { stut();}
  public void stut() { if (y == null) {y = "cat";} else {y = y + y;}}
}
public class Sub extends Super {
  private String x;
  public Sub (String s) { x = s;}
  @Override public void stut() {
     x = x + x;
  }
  public static void main(String[] args) {
      Super s = new Sub("dog");
  }
}
</pre>
<OL>
<LI>	Is the constructor in <code>Super</code> invoked?  Why or why not?
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
<br><b>Answer:</b>  Yes.  There is an implicit
call to <code>super();</code>
as the very first instruction
in the <code>Sub</code> constructor
<LI>	Is the <code>stut()</code> method in <code>Super</code> invoked?
	Why or why not?
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
<br><b>Answer:</b>  No. The <code>stut()</code> method is overridden
in class <code>Sub</code>, and so the class <code>Sub</code>
<code>stut()</code> method is invoked instead.
<LI>	Is the <code>stut()</code> method in <code>Sub</code> invoked?
	Why or why not?
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
<br><b>Answer:</b>  Yes. See the answer to the previous question.
<LI>	The execution of
	<code>main()</code> in </code>Sub</code>
	terminates with an exception.
	Which one, and why?
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
<br><b>Answer:</b>  <code>NullPointerException</code>.
	The reason is that the <code>+</code>
	operator is called on <code>x</code> while x is still null.
<br>
<b>Note:</b>  Correction:  There is no exception.  It turns out that null + null returns the
string "nullnull".
<br>
Because the question is broken, everyone gets credit!
<LI>	Which rule in Bloch does this code violate?
	(Any reasonable phrasing of the principle is fine.)
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
<br><b>Answer:</b>  The rule that says "Constructors
       (in classes that may be extended) must not invoke
	overridable methods."
