<P>
EagleMan is my first venture into long distance triathlons.
Not only do I want to finish,
but I want to finish in good condition.
At the moment I cross the finish line, I want
to believe that I could continue.
I want to imagine it plausible
to get right back into the Choptank
and repeat the entire course.
The reason, of course, is that EagleMan is only a half Ironman.
I want to finish strong because
I someday hope to complete a full Ironman.

<P>
`Only a half Ironman' is dangerous thinking.
A half Ironman is plenty long
to make multiple mistakes
and pay for each one.
One of the interesting aspects of endurance
events is the decoupling between mistakes and consequences.
Early mistakes are punished with late penalties.

For this back of the pack triathlete,
the real competitors in EagleMan are
the elements and the condition of my body.
If I manage these,
I will count the day a victory,
even through the real winner
will have had time for a shower, lunch, and a nap before I finish.
The hard part is 
maintaining sufficient awareness
to make the right decision at the right time.

<P>
The goal of finishing in good condition drives my race planning.
The key is to go easy,
a surprisingly difficult thing to do in a race.
I expect hundreds of other triathletes -
stronger triathletes,
faster triathletes,
smarter triathletes -
to swim, bike, and run on past.
Each time one passes, my mind must tell my body:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Don't swim hard; just stay balanced.
Don't hammer on the bike; just relax.
Don't push on the run; just get there.
Don't hurry transitions; just change clothes.
Don't panic when something goes wrong; just fix it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
In theory,
this plan should handle most of the problems
I can anticipate.
As an added bonus,
the plan,
if successful,
should give me the chance to trot past scores
of bonked out triathletes on the back
half of the run.
The alternative is being one of those bonked out triathletes.

Preparation
 </H2>
</CENTER>

<P>
Not surprisingly, 
my preparation for the swim and bike pales
next to that for the run.
My running has progressed to the point where I
can run marathons on a whim with reasonable results.
In fact, I <i> do </i> run the
<A HREF="http://www.pittsburghmarathon.com">Pittsburgh Marathon</A>
on a whim.
Two weeks before the race,
I learn that Bert has decided to run Pittsburgh.
The next day, I sign up.
It is too late to train,
although I have been working in 18 mile runs every few weeks.
I don't bother to taper.
I board a Greyhound for Pittsburgh, meet Bert,
and run the race.

<P>
We both turn in PRs, even though the weather is hot
by marathon standards.
We walk for 15 or 20 seconds each mile for the
first 20 miles.
We stay focused.
Our reward is excellent pacing
of 8:28 miles on the
first 10 miles
and 8:33 on the next 10 miles,
which include an elevation increase of 200 vertical feet.
On the last 10 km,
we agree to run individually,
depending on our respective conditions.
I manage 8:24 over this stretch,
helped in large part by the corresponding elevation decrease.
In fact, running faster downhill saves my quadriceps from
excess pounding, and I recover quickly.
I finally bag the elusive goal of a marathon at an 8:30 pace.
Let's see, to qualify for
<A HREF="http://www.bostonmarathon.org">Boston</A>
as a 40 year old male, I need
to get that down to ... a 7:38 pace.
Don't hold your breath; it will be a while.

<P>
Hyponatremia strikes both of us.
At mile 18 our stomachs begin to bloat.
Our bodies are not absorbing water,
and each additional sip is a hindrance, not a help.
The dilute vegetable broth
I have been drinking in hopes of maintaining my sodium levels is not enough.
The problem is heat;
our bodies are not used to hot weather running.
We are simply sweating out too much salt.
Finally, on the drive home, our kidneys remove the extra
water we ingested.
Consequently, we stop at each and every rest area on the turnpike,
a state of affairs that Becky finds highly amusing.

<P>
After careful consideration of the unusual heat in the weather forecast,
Becky and I decide that Matt would have a better
day with his grandparents in Lancaster than he would in Cambridge.
Consequently, I drive to the Eastern shore by myself.
It turns out that Matt would have had a great time.
Camping is possible right by the transition area,
not to mention boat rides on the Cheasapeake
and such like.

<P>
I have a hotel room in Easton, but after
sussing out the camping,
I decide to save the hundred bucks.
Although the clerk says that I will be charged if another
customer cannot be found,
I know that hotel rooms are very tight.
Sure enough, my room is resold within an hour.

<P>
I pick up my packet, which includes a cool day-glo
orange wrist bracelet. 
At the prerace pasta bash, I strike up a conversation
with a doctor named Jeff who is doing an internship in Bethesda.
Jeff explains that Eagleman was a last minute decision,
and that finding a room was quite difficult.
He was ultimately successful in Easton.
Amazingly enough, his room turns out to be <i> my </i> room.

<P>
Jeff studied medicine in Chicago,
and then rode his bike to Bethesda when he finished.
Eagleman is only Jeff's second triathlon;
his first was an Ironman.
If this sounds backwards to you, you're right; it is.
After the race I check the results on the web;
I am happy to report that Jeff made it to the finish line.

<P>
Since I wasn't planning to camp, I have neither
tent nor sleeping bag.
I sleep in the car next to a family of nesting ospreys.
As the night progresses, I move the bike around
to vacate different potential sleeping positions.
None prove to be either comfortable or warm.
Dawn is most welcome.
Race day has arrived.

Lessons

<P>
As it turns out, I join the parade of bonked out triathletes
on the back half of the run.
The middle of the run course features an out and back dog
leg totaling a mere three miles.
But here time slows to a crawl;
I seem to spend the entire day
running just this small length.
That,
and the astonishing rate at which my head melts ice,
are clear signals that the sun and heat are winning.
I pass almost no one; 
but lots of runners pass me.
I am grateful to the point of tears
just to cross the finish line.
I wade into the Choptank to cool off.
I could not repeat the course again this day.
In fact, it is hard work simply to walk back to the car.

<P>
On my way I stop by the finish line
to applaud
the efforts of a few of the late finishers.
There isn't any shade, so I don't last very long,
but it feels good to repay this small debt.

<P>
Eagleman teaches the importance of avoiding sun the day before the race
and that sport sunblock won't last through a half Ironman.
Eagleman teaches that theory and practice diverge when it comes
to the timing, magnitude, and direction of currents in the Cheasapeake.
Eagleman teaches how hard it is to stay hydrated when the temperature breaks 90.
Eagleman teaches that eating too late on the bike yields nausea on the run.
Other races have taught me similar lessons.
Perhaps this time I will learn them.

<p>
Eagleman also teaches the siren call of endurance.
For the entire weekend I feel it resonate in the serene beauty of the
<A HREF="http://www.dnr.state.md.us/baylinks/guides.html">
Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge</A>.
This lesson I know by heart.
Stronger or not, faster or not, smarter or not:
I'll be back.
