In Usenet tradition, I have recorded my impressions
of some of my road races, trail runs, and triathlons.
I am pleased to share them.
Occasionally I receive a message that one of my reports
has nudged someone over the edge.
If you are on the edge too,
then read on ... and sign up.
You'll be glad you did.
You don't need talent or experience,
just desire:
<blockquote>
The word <b>amateur</b> has come by the thousand oddities of
language to convey an idea of tepidity; whereas the word itself has the
meaning of passion.
Nor is this peculiarity confined to the mere form of the word;
the actual characteristic of these nameless dilettanti is a
genuine fire and reality.
A man must love a thing very much if he not only practices
it without any hope of fame or money, but even practices
it without any hope of doing it well.
Such a man must love the toils of the work more than
any other man can love the rewards of it.
-- <i>G.K. Chesterton</i>
