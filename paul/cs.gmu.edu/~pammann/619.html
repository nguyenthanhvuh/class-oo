<h3>
Course Description</h3>
To give the students a solid understanding of modern software construction.
To prepare students to construct sequential and concurrent programs. To
encourage the construction of software systems of high quality. In-depth
study of software construction in a modern language including control structuring
and packaging. Concepts such as information hiding, data abstraction, and
object-based and object-oriented software construction are discussed and
illustrated. This course is part of the core of the SWE program. This section
of 619 uses Java.

</ul>

<p>
Note on the course materials:  We'll start with Liskov.  Don't worry about the publication date; 
Liskov is basically a math book, and hence ages remarkably well.  
We're interested in contracts, mutability, data abstraction, and type abstraction.
Bloch is concerned about the same things,
but explores them in more detail and in more up-to-date Java.
Bloch also corrects some important points 
that weren't well understood when Liskov's text came out.

<h3>
          Weekly schedule
</h3>
This class is a group-based, hybrid synchronous, online offering.
That means you need to be present in class at class time.
You will also need to schedule regular meetings with your group 
and with me (and possibly the GTA)
outside of class.
<p>
This is my second offering of this class in a full-time online format.
Mostly, we'll do what I did last fall, but there are some updates and tweaks.
<p>
Each week will cover a small number of related technical 
issues (see course schedule).
Let's call this small number of technical issues a "topic".
Each topic will follow roughly the same sequence of preparation, 
in-class learning activities, homework completion and (possibly) presentation, 
and knowledge assessment.
To make this scale in an online environment, many of these activities
will be group based.  (See a later section in the syllabus on
my view of the importance of interactive learning.)
The sequence is:
<UL>
<LI>  Preparation:  Complete assigned readings and watch relevant videos, if any.
<LI>  Reading Reflection: This is a formal opportunity for each group to 
reflect on the reading. 
<LI>Synchronous Class Meeting (BB Collaborate):
<UL>
<LI> Prior week's homework solution presentation and discussion.
This is typically a randomly selected group, 
but occasionally, I'll do the presentation.
<LI> Reading reflection summary
<LI>
Combined session on the day's topic, followed by in-class
exercises (group breakouts)
<LI>
Break
<LI>
Combined session on the day's topic, followed by in-class
exercises (group breakouts)
<LI>
Wrap up
</UL>
<LI> Homework (group-based).
<LI> Individual oral assessments.

</UL>
<h3>
          Grading 
</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Group Functioning (group-based) :10%</li>
            <li>Reading Reflections (group-based) :10%</li>
            <li>Homework assignments (group-based): 15%</li>
            <li>Oral Assessments (individual): 35% </li>
            <li>Final exam (individual): 30%</li>
          </ul>
Each of these grade components is discussed below.
<hr>



<h3>
          Group Functioning
</h3>
	Every student needs to be part of a group.  
	I would prefer that groups stay stable throughout the semester,
	but if there is a good rationale to reconfigure a group or two,
	we'll do that.

<p>
Group size:  2 to 4 students.
<p>
Group creation mechanism:  As a default, we'll drop students into groups
at random.   If you are happy with your random group, great!
If you prefer a different group, during the first week you will have the option
to re-group.
If your group dwindles to just yourself, you'll need to join another group.
<p>
At the end of the semester, each individual will provide an assessment of the
rest of their group.  This assessment will determine the "Group Functioning"
part of the grade.
<p>
Groups can communicate internally through any mechanism they choose: zoom, discord,
google docs, whatever.  
<h3>
          Reading Reflections
</h3>
Each week, each <b>group</b> must complete a "reading reflection"
the day <b>before</b> class.
(That means midnight Sunday, in the case of this class, since
class meetings are Monday afternoon.)
I will review these assessments before class, compile the overall
responses, and use them to tune the in-class activities.
Reading reflections are available on Blackboard.
These reflections are part of the learning process
rather than the assessment process.
That is, they don't assess whether you have achieved mastery
of the new material,
rather they check whether you have done the necessary preparation.
<p>
<b>Important</b>:  There are no make-ups.
<p>
<b>Note</b>:  The reading reflections work really well.  I plan to 
keep those when classes return to F2F - hopefully, in Fall 2021.
<p>
<b>Note</b>:  Please! Only one submission per <b>group</b>.  Everyone in the group
gets the same credit.

<h3>
          Homework Assignments
</h3>
	  There are weekly <b>group</b> homework assighments.
          I post homework assignments on the class web site.
          Generally, your group should submit assignments via 
          <a href="http://mymasonportal.gmu.edu" Target = "_blank">Blackboard</a>.
<p>
          Because of the way in which this class is taught, it is important to stay on pace.
          Homeworks are due <U>before class</U>.  Late submissions are not
	accepted except in truly exceptional circumstances.
<p> <b>Important:</b>
	Each group should be prepared to present
	their homework solution in class. 
      
<p>
        <b>Important: Statement of who did what.</b>
	Homeworks are group exercises.
	Each submission must contain a specific statement of who did what.
<p>
        <b>Important:  Solutions and solution checking.</b>
	The group must split their roles on each exercise.  Part
	of the group creates the solution.   
	A separate part of the group checks the solution,
	certifies that it is correct, 
	and <b>explains why it is correct</b>.
	If you can't formulate this explanation, it's time 
	for your group to see me or the GTA in office hours.
	Note that this model is common in engineering, where engineers sometimes
	create solutions and other times certify solutions.
	You should rotate roles within your group from week to week.
<h3>
          Oral Assessments
</h3>
	Ideally, oral assessments should happen every week.
	But I don't have the bandwidth to make that happen. 
	Instead, every student will schedule an oral assessment once every *two* weeks.
<p>
Process:
<UL>
<LI>	Scheduling: While each student will complete each assessment individually,
	we will schedule assessments by group.    
	Students in odd numbered gropus 
	should schedule themselves for an assessment
	in weeks with odd-numbered oral assessment guides.
	Students in even numbered gropus 
	should schedule themselves for an assessment
	in weeks with even-numbered oral assessment guides.

<LI>	Duration:  Each assessment lasts 10 minutes.  
	This is a little tight, but generally works.
	
<LI>	I will be forthcoming and concrete about the content for each assessment.
	I'll do this in the form of "Oral Assessment Guides" posted to 
	the course schedule.
	That is, you shouldn't be surprised by any of the questions.
	Often, they will be closely related to the prior week's homework.
	The questions will typically look like, "What would Liskov (or Bloch)
	think of the following variation(s) of this snippet of code we studied
	last week?  And why would they think that?"
<LI> 	Not every student will get the same quiz, even if the quiz is on
	the same day.  I promise to be fair about this.
<LI>	The evaluation scale is as follows:
<UL>
<LI>	Awesome == You demonstrate mastery of the material.  Scores 10/10.
<LI>	Strong performance, but perhaps a slight wobble:  Scores 9/10.
<LI>	Acceptable, but some significant errors:  Scores 8/10.
<LI>	Weak: Scores 5/10 to 7/10.
<LI>	Unacceptable:  Scores 0/10.
</UL>
	Make-ups.  The goal is to get you to understand the material.
	So, if you score as "Weak" or "Unacceptable", I'll give you an
	opportunity for a make-up.  The maximum score on a make-up is 8/10.
	Before I'll admit you for a make-up, you will have to practice
	with the GTA.  If the GTA gives me the green light, I'll schedule
	a make-up.
</UL>

<h3>
          Participation - Piazza Points
</h3>
          SWE 619 will use the 
          <a href="https://piazza.com/gmu/fall2020/swe619" target="_blank">Piazza</a> 
          software for a discussion board and for posting updates.
          Participation on the discussion board counts towards your grade.
          Here's the deal:  
          A constructive, relevant, non-redundant post earns a Piazza point.
          Here are some examples:
<UL>
<LI>      A question that elicits a substantive, correct answer.
<LI>      A substantive, correct answer to another student's question.
<LI>      A substantive, correct refinement or clarification of another student's answer to a question.
<LI>      A pointer (with discussion) that links a class topic to something external (and relevant).
<LI>      A correction to anything substantive that I get wrong!
</UL>
          You can earn one Piazza point, but no more, in any given week.   (A "week" is
          defined as the way Piazza tracks weeks.)
          You're done earning points after you hit the magic number 5, 
          but you are, of course, still welcome to continue posting.
          Participation must occur during the semester, not after final exams start.
          Note:  starting early is good strategy.
            <li>Participation (individual): 5%</li>
-->
<h3>
          Final Exam
</h3>
          There will be a final exam appropriate for the online,
	unproctored nature of this class offering.  
	I plan to offer an oral option as well
	as a written option.  The last class of the semester will include
	a detailed discussion of the exam structure and contents.
<HR>
<h3>
          Class Attendance
</h3>
           I place great emphasis on peer learning and interactive engagement.
	   <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/~pammann/teaching/interactive.html">
	   Here's why.</a>
	I have structured the class to leverage group interactions to the largest
	extent possible for the purpose of maximizing 
	learning gain through out the semester.
<p> Bottome line:  It's important to be in class.
<h3>
          In-Class Exercises
</h3>
      
          I plan an in-class exercise for every class.
          Students will work in their designated group.
          Some of these exercises need a Java development environment.
	  Very often, the in-class exercises will be closely related
	  to an upcoming homework assignment.
<!--
          These exercises will be used to monitor attendance.
-->
          <!-- and assist and / or allow students to hands-on software development. -->
<h3>
          ShowMe Videos/Other videos
</h3>
	The course schedule page links to a number of short videos created
	with the <a href="http://showme.com">ShowMe</a> service.
	Some students find these helpful for grasping key points
	from various lectures.
	Several items of note:
	<OL>
	<LI> Each ShowMe captures an interaction a student has with me.
		Such interactions can help students master the material
		more effectively than having me drone on solo.
	<LI> I am interested in creating more ShowMe videos for other
		topics in the course.  
		Contact me if you would like to help me do this.
	<LI> I am open to redoing existing topics if there is something
		you think could be done better.
	<LI> Other videos are just me.  
	</OL>
      
<h3>
          Record Keeping
</h3>
	We'll use Blackboard to maintain <b>RAW</b> scores and attendance data.  
	Grades are computed according to <b>this syllabus</b>.
	There is a column in BB labeled "TOTAL": Ignore it; it's meaningless for this class.
	(BB, in typical BB arrogance, does not give me the option of disabling or hiding this column.)
<p>
	It's the student's responsibility to ensure that Blackboard records are correct.  
	(I'm happy to correct errors.)
<p>
Every semester, I get email from students wondering why there grade doesn't correspond to
the TOTAL column in BB.   Please don't be the student who sends me this message.

<h3>
          Email
</h3>
          Please note that questions of general interest should not be emailed 
          to me.  Post on Piazza instead.
<h3>
          Virginia Privacy Laws
</h3>
          The state of Virginia now has laws that require the University (including me) not to
          disclose student email addresses, phone numbers, and addresses.
          This will impact communications in this class as follows:
          <UL>
          <LI> Communicating via email with groups of students is problematic.   (Bcc is a partial
               but not very good, solution.)  As far as I have been able to determine,
               Piazza does not make student emails visible to 
               other students, even though instructors can see email addresses.
               Hence, this is another reason to favor the Piazza forum.
          <LI> <b>You</b> can choose to disclose your email whenever and wherever you wish.  
                That's up to you.
          </UL>
<h3>
          Piazza
</h3>
<P>
          I find anonymous discussions unhelpful in this class;
          here learning is predicated on interactions.   
  	  Plus, part of your education
          is to learn to stand behind your questions and ideas.  That's how employees
          function in the working world.   Piazza allows
          partial, but not complete, control of anonymous posts.
          Should someone post anonymously, I will ask the poster to change the visibility
          and ask the class not to respond to the anonymous version.


<h3>
          Honor Code
</h3>
          As with all GMU courses,
          SWE 619 is governed by the <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code/" target="_blank">GMU Honor Code</a>.
          In this course, <B>all</B> oral assessments and the final exam 
          carry with them an implicit statement that it is the sole work of the author.
	Further, all group submissions require a statement
	of participation from each member of the group.
<h3>
          Learning Disabilities
</h3>
        
          Students with learning disabilities (or other conditions documented with GMU Office of Disability Services) 
          who need academic accommodations should see me and contact the
          <a href="http://ods.gmu.edu/" target="_blank">Disability Resource Center</a> (DRC) at (703)993-2474.
	  I am more than happy to assist you, but
          all academic accommodations must be arranged through the DRC.
