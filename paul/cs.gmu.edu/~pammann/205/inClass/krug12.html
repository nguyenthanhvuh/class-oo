Work with your group
<p>
The point of this exercise is for you to experience the web in the context
of accessibility.
<OL>
<LI> Choose an alternate experience and install an appropriate browser extension.
Three suggestions for Chrome:  
<UL>
<LI> ChromeVox (giving voice to chrome):  You can use this to experience
what it's like to navigate a site by sound instead of sight.
<LI>
Colorblinding (simulates color-blindness).  
The color schemes on some pages don't work for color-blind users.
<LI>
Navigating a web page without the use of a mouse.
(No browser extension is necessary here.)
</UL>
The browser extensions install pretty fast.
If you want to choose an alternate meaning for "different experience", that's ok too.
<LI>
Surf the web and look for problematic experiences.
</OL>



Restriction:  Pick web sites where usability is decent.
<p>
We'll reconnect at 2:20 to share.
