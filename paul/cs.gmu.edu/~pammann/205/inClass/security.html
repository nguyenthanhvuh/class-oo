Work with your group.

<p>
In this exercise
I want you to find two examples relating usability and security.
These can be cyber-security, but they can also be physical security.
Ideally, these examples are from personal experience, but that's not required.
<p>
One example should follow the argument in the slides:  decreased usability leads to decreased security.
(Or, you can flip it around as increased usability leads to increased security.)

<p>
The other example should follow the reverse argument:  
decreasing usability can sometimes increase security.
In some ways, this is a much more interesting exercise, because it's not usability
in general that's lost, but rather some very specific aspect of it.
<!--
Norman has some great examples of this on page 255 in his
discussion of "Deliberately Making Things Difficult."
I plan to spend some time talking about this case on Tuesday.

<p>
Be prepared to present your examples to class.
