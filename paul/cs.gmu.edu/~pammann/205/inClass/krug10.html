  <li>Find an application that has a mobile version (i.e. and app) 
and a large-screen (i.e. desktop) version.
  <li>Compare the two versions.
  <ul>
    <li>How are they different?
    <li>Did the designers reorganize the information appropriately for mobile?
    <li>Does the small-screen version have and/or need a link to the large-screen version?
    <li>Which one has better usability?  Justify your answer as precisely
	as you can.
  </ul>
</ol>
Restriction:  Pick an application where the usability is decent.

We'll reconnect at 2:20 to share.
