Work with your group.

<ol>
<LI>
Ko asserts that user interfaces mediate three kinds of interaction:  
automation, information, and communication.
She also notes that some interfaces mediate more than one kind of interaction.
<LI>
For each of the three kinds, identify an interface that (mostly) mediates just that one kind of interaction.
Call out how the interface achieves the objectives Ko states are necessary for that kind of interface.
</ol>
If there is time, repeat for pairs
and/or find an interface that does all three.
<p>
<b>Avoid Ko's examples.</b>  
<br> <br>
We'll share examples towards the end of class.
