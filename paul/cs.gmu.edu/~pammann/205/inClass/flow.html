  Flow and Orchestration

<p class="inclass">
This is an <b>in-class group exercise</b>.
<p>
Cooper list strategies for designing interactions that go with the user's flow:
<UL>
<LI> Follow user's mental models
<LI> Less is more
<LI> Let users direct rather than discuss
<LI> Provide choices rather than questions
<LI> Keep necessary tools close at hand
<LI> Provide modeless feedback
<LI> Design for the probable, but anticipate the possible
<LI> Contextualize information
<LI> Reflect object and application status
<LI> Avoid unnecessary reporting
<LI> Avoid blank slates
<LI> Differentiate between command and configuration
<LI> Hide ejector seat levers
<LI> Optimize for responsiveness but accommodate latency
</UL>
<p>
This is "short-form" practice for assignment 4.  
We're looking for <em>witnesses</em> and/or <em>counterexamples</em>.
Choose a (software-related) interface.  
(You might want to use your example from the reading reflection.)
You should limit attention
to a specific task or use-case.
The interface should be <em>different than</em>  the one you are using
for assignment 4.
Explain how flow for that task is supported (or not) by Cooper's strategies.
<p>
Note:  If you finish early, feel free to start on homework 4.
<p>

We'll discuss in the last 15 minutes of class.  Be prepared to defend your determination 
of witnesses and counterexamples with justification from the Cooper's list.
