<p class="inclass">
This is an <b>in-class group exercise</b>.
Do this with everyone in your group.   You
can see your group asssignment on Piazza.
(Even if you are planning to change your group from 
the random assignment, please just go with your random group now.)
<p>
Each person in the group should:

<ol>
<li> Introduce themselves.
<li> Learn the names of everyone else.
<li> Share something about yourself that is important to you and why.
	(My example: I'm really into long-distance running.
	Why?  Because, even though I've been doing it for decades,
	it's a continous puzzle to stay on track.  There
	are <em>so</em> many variables - training, pacing, recovery, food, clothing, 
	overall condition, etc. -
	and it's so easy to get them wrong.  Which makes it really
	satisfying when they go right.)
</ol>
<li> Identify an object that the group thinks has <em>great</em> usability.
	Stay away from computer programs and apps on your phone.
    <UL>
    <LI> What is the object?
    <LI> Precisely what makes it have great usability?
	The point of this exercise is to highlight the importance of
	a proper vocabulary to describe what does - and doesn't - make
	something usable.
</ol>
We'll synchronized before the end of class.
