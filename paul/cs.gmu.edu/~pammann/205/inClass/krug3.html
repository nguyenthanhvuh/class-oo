Work with your group.
<p>
This is closely related to the homework due Thursday.
(Note:  As with some prior homework,
if you present a specific example today, your homework should be different.)
<p>
Here are Krug's guidelines from Chapter 3.

<UL>
<LI> Conventions are your friend.
<LI> Create effective visual hierarchies.
<LI> Break up pages into clearly defined areas.
<LI> Make it obvious what's clickable.
<LI> Keep the noise down to a dull roar.
<LI> Format text to support scanning.
</UL>

<p>
  Find (reasonable) example web pages that 
	violate one or more of these principles.
  <ul>
     <li>Briefly describe which guideline(s) is(are) violated.
     <li>Explain how the page could be improved.
	If you have time, mock up the change.
  </ul>

<p>
We'll synch up at 2:15 and see what the various groups have come up with.
