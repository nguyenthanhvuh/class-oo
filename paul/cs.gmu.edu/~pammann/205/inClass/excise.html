<p>
Cooper 12 introduces the notion of <em>excise</em>,
and discusses four different types of excise (navigational, skeuomorphic, modal, and stylistic).
<p>
Find a pair of related interfaces that differ with respect to one of these types of excise.
(As Cooper shows, the pair could be different versions of the same interface.)
<p>
Explain the differences in excise, and explain the type of work
(cognitive, memory, visual, physical)
the excise requires .
If possible, explain the design decisions that led to these differences.
<p>
Repeat for other types of excise as time allows.
<UL>
<LI>
Avoid Cooper's examples.
<LI>
Don't pick bad software.  It's just not that interesting.
