Work with your group.
<p>
Krug 1 has examples of the same functionality that
range from "Obvious" to "Requires Thought".
<p>
Find more examples!

<p>
We'll synch up at 2:15 and see what folks have.
To make your presentation to the rest of the class clearer,
please grab some screen shots to illustrate your points.
Something like Krug has would be great.
