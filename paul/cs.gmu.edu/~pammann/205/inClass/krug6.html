Work with your group.
We won't synch back up afterwards;
instead, that will happen Thursday when groups 
present their trunk test reports.
The purpose of today's exercise is preparation:
I want to see some really good trunk tests Thursday!
<p>
One way to think of Krug's trunk test is as a super light-weight 
part of the usability 
testing he describes in Chapter 9.
If you remember anything from this class 6 months from 
now, it should be how important and doable usability testing
is. 
<p>
Today's exercise is practicing the trunk
test on sites <em>other</em> than the one you have chosen
for your Thursday presentation.
(So far, there's only one website claimed.)
The TAs and I will surf group to group and see how you
are doing at it.
