  SWE 205 In-Class Exercise<br>
  Affordances and Signifiers
 </h1>
</center>

<hr>

Work with your group (as identified on Piazza).
<br>

<p>


For some of the objects below:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>
Identify affordances, intended or otherwise.
<LI>
Identify signifiers for the intended affordances.
(Note that unintended affordances cannot, by definition, have associated signifiers.)
<LI>
Often, information for how to access an object's affordances is <em>not</em> visible.
That is, signifiers may be deliberately left out.
If appropriate, identify this situation.
How is this situation typically dealt with?
</UL>
Possible objects
<UL>
<LI> Sunglasses.
<LI> An (old-school) metal house key.
<LI> A link in a desktop browser window.
<LI> An icon on a phone screen.
<LI> One or more objects chosen by your group.  (I'd like to see at least one of these.)
</UL>
