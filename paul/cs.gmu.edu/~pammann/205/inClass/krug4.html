Work with your group.
<p>
In Chapter 4, Krug distinguishes mindless clicks from difficult
choices.
In the reading reflection, most students thought that 
the latter were often (but not always) 
more a result of poor design than inherent complexity.
Let's see that in action!

<p>
 Find a (reasonable) web page with:
<UL>
<LI> What you believe is a difficult choice
<LI> That could be made less difficult with better design
</UL>
Be prepared to explain why you think the choice
is difficult and why you think the redesign alleviates the difficulty.
If you have time, do a quick mock-up to illustrate your redesign.

<p>
We'll synch up at 2:15 and see what the various groups have come up with.
