Work with your group.
This is prep work for Thursday's assignment.
<ol>
    <li>Select a site for your usability test.  
     You may have already recorded this on Piazza; if not, so do as ASAP.
    <li>Review <a href ="http://sensible.com/downloads-rsme.html">Krug's scripts.</a>
    <li>For your site, work up 2 tasks.
	These task should be on the scale of the examples given in Krug's 
	video.
	These are things that normal users would want to do
	but either aren't obvious or require several steps.
</ol>
We'll synch at 2:20 to have groups describe their tasks.   
There may be (group) feedback at this time that you
should modify your tasks or perhaps favor one over the other.
