  Flow
 </h1>
</center>

<p>
Cooper 11 introduces the notion of <em>flow</em>.
As an example, a Norman
door stops the pedestrian from doing whatever it is they are doing and forces
them to think about how to open that particular door.
In other words, a Norman door breaks flow, and
that's precisely why a Norman door is annoying.
It's not that we can't figure the door out (most of the time, anyway).  
It's that we're being forced to figure it out when the door should ideally escape our conscious 
notice entirely.
<p>
Cooper further describes a set of techniques around the notion of <em>orchestration</em>
that can help the designer come up with an interface that induces flow.
<p>
Assignment:
Choose an interface and analyze it for <em>flow</em>.
Unlike the Norman door, your example should be software-related.
You may need to restrict attention to a particular task on that interface.
<p>
You should mostly focus on <em>witnesses</em>,
but you should also keep an eye out for <em>counterexamples</em>.
<UL>
<li>
For witnesses, clearly justify your selection using the language of orchestration
in Cooper.  (Use only what applies; don't make stuff up, please.)
<li>
For counterexamples, clearly explain what is wrong, again in the language of orchestration
from Cooper, and propose specific alternatives that would be a witnesses instead.
</UL>
Notes:
<UL>
<LI>
You can't use a university information system, or something similar, as a counterexample.  There's no point.
That is, don't pick bad software.   Pick good software.
Even good software could be better.
<LI>
Aim for short, precise solutions.   The TAs and I will grade on content
and clarity, not volume.
</UL>
Submit your solution on Piazza
and be prepared to explain your example to the class.
