<p>
Chapter 5 addresses writing.
I want you to find a reasonable web page that nonetheless
could be improved by following Krug's guidelines for rewriting it.

You should produce two artifacts:
<OL>
<LI>	A screenshot of the original page.
<LI>	A rewritten (and improved) version of that original page.  
</OL>
You also need a commentary that explains the changes.  
This can be a separate document
or some form of annotation on the two prior artifacts.
Be clear about what changes were made, and why the
changes implement specific guidelines from Krug.
<p>
Note that you may also need to use some of Krug's other guidelines 
for writing from Chapter 3
(formatting, headers, bullets, etc.)
Use those as appropriate.


<p>
Post your solution on Piazza.
Be prepared to share your example with the class.
