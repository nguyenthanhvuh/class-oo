  Usability Testing
 </h1>
</center>

<hr/>
The most practical skill Krug offers 
is a step-by-step
guide to cheap, fast usability testing.
Note that the text contains the guide,
but the artifacts (videos, draft documents, etc.) 
supporting the guide are on a
website of another of his texts:
<br>
<a href="https://www.sensible.com/rsme.html">www.sensible.com<a/>

<p>
Assignment 9 has 2 deliverables:
<OL>
<LI>	A report on a usability test carried out by your
	group on a reasonable web site.
	Please choose a site:
<UL>
<LI> That you have not analyzed previously.
<LI> That you do not regularly use.
</UL>
	Make sure you fill in Krug's test script with
	the specific tasks relevant to your test.
<LI>   A report on the debriefing.  Note that Krug
	has strong constraints on what this debriefing should
	produce.  Please adhere to those constraints.
</OL>

Notes:

<UL>
<LI>
Unlike other solutions, prepare your report
as a self-contained document instead of as an in-line Piazza post.
Post your document (or a link to it) on Piazza and
be prepared to present your results with the class.
Make your test script an appendix in your document.
<LI>
Krug specifically discusses remote usability testing,
which, obviously, is how your group will need to proceed.
<LI>
Again, to keep the websites from the different groups disjoint,
please post to Piazza twice:  The first time, just post the URL
you have chosen for the usability test.  (First come, first serve!)
The second time, follow-up to your first post 
to add your document.
</UL>
