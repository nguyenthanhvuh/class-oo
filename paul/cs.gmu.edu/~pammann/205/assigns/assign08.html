Krug Chapter 6 addresses navigation.
Krug suggests the "Trunk Test" as a
means of evaluating how well web site
designers have addressed navigation.  
The assignment is to do the trunk test.

Choose a reasonable web page on a reasonable site.  
Don't choose a form page, and don't choose the home page.
Choose a page you don't visit regularly or at all.
<p>
Each member of the group should do the trunk test independently
on the same page.

Four deliverables:
<OL>
<LI>	A screenshot of the page.
<LI>	A summary of each group member's results from the trunk test.
<LI>	If the results differ (which is a reasonable outcome),
	explain why.
	(At this point in the semester, it should go without
	saying that this outcome is almost certainly a 
	problem with the website, 
	and not the "fault" of the person carrying out the test.
	But I'll say it anyway.)
<LI>	A mark-up of the screenshot showing the changes
	Krug would recommend to address problems identified
	by the trunk test.  Be specific about
	which guidelines from Krug you believe are appropriate.
</OL>


<p>
Post your solution on Piazza.
Be prepared to share your example with the class.
<P>
Note:  To keep the websites from the different groups disjoint,
please post to Piazza twice:  The first time, just post the URL
you have chosen for the trunk test.  (First come, first serve!)
The second time, follow-up to your first post 
to add your deliverables.
