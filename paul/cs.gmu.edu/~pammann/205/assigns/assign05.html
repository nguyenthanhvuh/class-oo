  Excise
 </h1>
</center>

<ol>
    <li>Consider two digital services your group has used within the last week.  
	The goal here is to find two services, one on each end of the excise spectrum.
	Don't use the same person for both interfaces.
 	While it would be handy for the interfaces to implement the same
	functionality and use case, this isn't necessary.
    <li> Describe a (simple) use-case with the interface that has excessive excise.  
	Tag each
	task in the use-case as "excise" or "goal-directed".
<UL>
<LI>
	Refine "excise" tags as one of Cooper's types (navigational, skeuomorphic, modal, or stylistic).
<LI>	Map these tags to the type(s) of work Cooper identifies (cognitive, memory, visual, physical).
<LI>	Justify your answers.
</UL>
    <li> Repeat for the interface that has the very little excise.
    <li> Analyze excise/revenue:
	<ul>
	<li>How could the first interface improve?   How much improvement is possible?
	<li>What design decisions in  the second interface made it score better?
  </ol>
</ol>

Be prepared to give a decent presentation in class.
You should consider using a demo of the interfaces instead of just showing
screen shots.
