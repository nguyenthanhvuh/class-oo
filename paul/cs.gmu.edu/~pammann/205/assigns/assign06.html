  Designing for Scanning

<p>
Krug Chapters 2 and 3 explain how web pages are used and
how web pages should be designed to support such use.
I want you to find a reasonable web page that nonetheless
could be improved by following some of Krug's specific guidelines.
For reference, these guidelines are:
<UL>
<LI> Conventions are your friend.
<LI> Create effective visual hierarchies.
<LI> Break up pages into clearly defined areas.
<LI> Make it obvious what's clickable.
<LI> Keep the noise down to a dull roar.
<LI> Format text to support scanning.
</UL>

You should produce two artifacts:
<OL>
<LI>	A screenshot of the original page.
<LI>	A redesigned page that uses some number of Krug's guidelines.
</OL>
You also need a commentary that explains the changes.  
This can be a separate document
or some form of commenting on the two prior artifacts.
Be clear about what changes were made, and why the
changes implement specific guidelines from Krug.


<p>
Post your solution on Piazza.
Be prepared to share your example with the class.
