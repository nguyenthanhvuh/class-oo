  Due Thursday January 28, 2021

<hr/>

<p>
This assignment has two parts.

<ol>
  <li>Introduce yourself to the class on
      <a href="http://piazza.com/gmu/spring2019/swe205" target="_blank">Piazza</a>.
      Tell us who you are:
      your major,
      your class (sophomore, ...),
      and why you are taking the class.
      Also, tell us one interesting thing about yourself
      and post a picture.
      For credit, 
<UL>
<LI> You must post your introduction as a follow-up to my Piazza introduction.
<LI> Your picture must be a reasonable size and orientation.
</UL>
      <br/> <br/>


  <li>
	Get your group figured out.  This means either informing the GTA (Piazza would be great for this) that your random group is fine.  Or it means interacting with the GTA until the
group assignment post on Piazza is where you want it to be.  Since this may cause some groups to disappear, some iteration is required.
</ol>

<p>
Note while the first part of this assignment is individual,
the second part is a group activity.
