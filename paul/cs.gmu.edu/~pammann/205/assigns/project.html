  SWE 205 Project<br>
  <font COLOR=red>Spring 2021</font><br>
  Design and Usability Analysis of an Interface 
 </h1>
</center>

<h3> Overview</h3>
<p>
The goal for this class is for you to be able to
analyze and design digital interactions from a usability perspective.
Part of this is being able to using
appropriate language and terminology,
part of this is identifying appropriate analysis approaches,
and part of this is choosing good solutions.
<p>
Hence, that's what this project assignment asks for and how your project will be evaluated.
<h3> Assignment</h3>
<p>
Choose a (digital) product to design.
One way to do this is choose something where you can do better,
in which case the goal is a re-design.
<p>
Describe the overall use case(s), and identify 3 to 5
key interactions.
For each one:
<UL>
	<LI> Describe the interaction.
	<LI> Analyze the interaction.
	<LI> Design your solution.
	<LI> Illustrate the advantage of your solution by showing (inferior) alternatives.
</UL>
These steps need to be specific and detailed.  See the grading section.

<h3> Milestones</h3>
<br>
Milestones:
<OL>
<LI>	Intitial project decription. (Due March 18).  
	Outline what you propose to do. Prize clarity over length.  Choose an interesing
	project - not something like BB or PW.  We'll grade this as a homework.
	One possible outcome is that we will ask you to resubmit.
<LI>	Full solutions/oral presentations. 
	(Replaces final exam; schedule with me and the GTA.)
	This is the full project grade.
</OL>
<h3> Grading</h3>
Overall use case: 
Is it interesting? Are your choices justified?  Is your project description clear?  Is it convincing?
Does it use appropriate language and terminology?
<br>
<br>
For the key interactions, grading criteria are:
<UL>
<LI> Appropriate usability analysis approach.
<LI> Appropriate usability conclusions.
<LI> Concrete, detailed solution.  You <em>don't</em> need a working implementation.  But you do need
	convincing mock-ups.  You can do this with html. Or you can do it with drawings.
	Or you can pick some other model.  But it has to be specific and concrete.
</UL>



<h3>Note</h3>
I want projects to be different.
To implement this, groups will post their chosen project (in a suitable thread).  
There is no particular due date on this, but it's first-come first-served:
If the project your group wants to do is already in the thread, 
you'll have to find a different project.
<p>
Note that some interfaces are very large, and so it may be possible to have
two groups working on different aspects of the same interface.
Check if you're not sure; the review panel (Paul, Ajit, Jimmy) will
make a determination.
