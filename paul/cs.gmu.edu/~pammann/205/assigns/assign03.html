  Mental Models
 </h1>
</center>

<p>
Ko explains that the product of learning an interface is a mental model
of how the object works.
Specifically, the user navigates the gulfs of execution and evaluation using the model.
One way of thinking about this model is that
if the gulfs are unnecessarily large, the model will be unnecessarily complex,
and vice versa.
<p>
Assignment:
Find a usability example where the model suggested by the interface differs
from what you think a reasonable mental model is for that interface.
You can use any type of object or service - digital or otherwise.
But you can't use any of the university information management systems (BB, PW, etc.).
<p>
Describe both models, highlighting the differences between them.
Explain the relationship between these differences and the relevant gulf (execution or evaluation).

<p>
Submit your solution on Piazza
and be prepared to explain your example to the class.
