<h3> Overview</h3>
<p>
The purpose of this document is to share the rubric
that Tim and I will use when grading your project.
<p>
<h3> Grading</h3>
The project is scored on a 20 points.
(Note that the project is 35% of the final grade.)
<OL>
<LI>
Overall use case:  (1 point)
Is your project description clear and convincing?
Do you justify your choices?  
Do you use appropriate language and terminology?
(Note that this has already been graded in the first milestone,
but we'll revisit it in the final project.)
<LI>
For the 3-5 key interactions, grading criteria are:
<UL>
<LI> For each interaction, appropriate usability analysis approach. (3 points)
<LI> For each interaction, appropriate usability conclusions. (3 points)
</UL>
<LI> Concrete, detailed solution.  
You <em>don't</em> need a working implementation.  But you do need
convincing mock-ups.  You can do this with html. Or you can do it with drawings.
Or you can pick some other model.  But it has to be specific and concrete.
(6 points technical quality of solution; "technical quality" means
"well grounded in criteria covered in class" - be explicit about this!
2 points clarity of written description of solution.)
<LI>
Presentation:
<UL>
<LI>
Appropriate for time frame (20 minute slots; 10 minute presentation; 5 minute Q&A.)
(2 points)
<LI>
Quality:  Presentation makes it clear exactly what you did and why you did it.
(2 points)
<br>
Note:  Technical difficulties will <em>not</em> factor into the grading.  Translation:
if webex (or whatever) bombs, we'll reschedule and have you present again.
</UL>
<br>
Note: Projects that lack a presentation won't be graded.
</UL>

<LI>  A statement of who did what in the group.
Either every group member needs to have made a substantive
contribution to the project. 
If not, the group member who did not contributed gets a zero on the project.  
(1 point)
<br>
Note: Projects that lack this statement won't be graded.
</OL>
