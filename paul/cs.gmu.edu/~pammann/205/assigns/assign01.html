<p>
A Norman Door is a door with inconsistent or missing signifiers for an (intended) affordance.
<p>
      Find a Norman Door somewhere in pandemic land.  
      Document your find (with a short video or
      some still shots).  Explain what the intended affordance is, and explain the 
      signifier problem with that affordance.   
<p>
      Doors can have all kinds of usability problems; not all problematic doors are Norman Doors.
      Find a door with a usability problem that is not a "Norman Door" problem.
      Document your find by explaining the usability problem.  In particular, 
      explain why it's not a Norman Door.  
      <p>
      Post your result to Piazza under an "Assignment 1 Solutions" thread.
	(If there isn't one - make one!)
      <p>
      <b>Be prepared to explain your solution to the class.</b>
      We'll fire up the 
<a href="https://cs.gmu.edu:8443/offutt/servlet/randomString" class="offsite" target=_blank">Randomizer</a>
      and enjoy some presentations.
