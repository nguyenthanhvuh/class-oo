<p>
For your final exercise,
create a
<b>one to two minute video</b>
to explain a usability principle from class.
A usability principle
should be a one-sentence declarative statement 
that tells designers to design something in a certain way.
Some examples are:
&ldquo;Maintain flow.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Unusable security ain't!.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bridge the gulf of execution (or evaluation).&rdquo;
and
&ldquo;Don't make me think!&rdquo;
</p>

<ol>
  <li>You can pick any principle you want.
      You must state or display your principle at the beginning of your video.
  <li>You can design, script, and produce your video any way you want.
      You can sit and talk into the camera,
      write an illustrative play,
      mime,
      draw cartoons, 
      use hand puppets,
      show examples on the computer,
      or whatever else you can think of.
      Be creative!
  <li>&ldquo;One to two minutes&rdquo; is not a precise requirement,
      but a general suggestion.
      Nothing over three minutes please.
  <li>You can record with your phone,
      your computer,
      or go to a recording studio, assuming you maintain social distancing.
  <li><b>Test your stuff!</b>  If the review panel has to come
	back to you because your video/audio/whatever is broken,
	we'll charge you for that.
  <li>As usual, work with your group.
</ol>

<p>
Post your video on Piazza.
</p>
From my perspective, these videos are one of
the most fun things about teaching this class.
Hence the rubric:
<em>
If you follow directions, you get credit.
If the the review panel laughs, you get a bonus point.  
If I share with other faculty, you get two bonus points.
