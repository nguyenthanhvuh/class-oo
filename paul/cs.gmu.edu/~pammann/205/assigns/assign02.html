  Gulfs
 </h1>
</center>

<p>
Ko explains the gulf of execution 
as the gap between the user's goal and the input they
have to provide to achieve it.
She explains the gulf of evaluation as the gap
between the output of a user interface and the user's goal.
Better designed interfaces tend to have smaller gulfs.
<p>
Assignment:
Choose a user goal (e.g. control the heat on a stovetop for a specific burner)
and two different interfaces that achieve that goal (e.g. two different
types of stovetop).
For each interface, describe the gulfs and explain which gulfs you think
are larger (and why).
Be specific:  what is it about the interface design that helps (or hinders) bridging the gulf?
In the stove example, the gulf of execution is smaller for a stove with
a layout for controls that geometrically matches the layout for burners.
The gulf of evaluation is smaller for a stove with clear indicators
for which burners are "hot" or "on".
<p>
If you think the gulfs can be ordered, do you think the interface with the smaller gulfs 
is better?  Explain.  Do you think the designer deliberately increased the gulfs
for some other reason - fashion, perhaps?
If you think the gulfs are incomparable, explain why.
<p>
Note:  Again, avoid computer/web/phone/video-game interfaces.  Stick to "real" objects.
If submitting late in the process, avoid objects that other groups have already
analyzed.

<p>
Submit your solution on Piazza in an appropriate thread.
Be prepared to explain your example to the class.
