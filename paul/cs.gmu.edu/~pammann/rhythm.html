A Different Kind of Run
 </H2>
</CENTER>



<p>
The Andiamo Trail Run is a low key event.  A handful of people make
their way from Purcelville to Shirlington, thereby covering all 45
miles of the W&OD Trail.  The event only runs in even years and doesn't
bother with race numbers.  Participants are indistinguishable from the
thousands of other trail users.

<p>
Normally, for me, this event serves as preparation for the JFK 50
Miler.  Normally, finishing is a foregone conclusion.  Normally, I try
to see how long I can maintain ten minute miles.  Normally, I aim to
finish under eight hours.  Normally, I don't have a care in the world.
Unfortunately, 2006 has been anything but normal.

<p>
Indeed, 2006 has been a tour of medical hell.  I'll be lucky if I
get to start.

<p>
Let me hasten to clarify that I am grateful that my medical issues
are not of the terminal variety.  Still, anytime the medics screw
around with your heart, it's serious.  The consent forms make clear that
you are on the edge; a slip here, an anomaly there, and down you go,
dragging your family along with you.  Just thinking about the
possibilities is enough to give you vertigo.

<p>
In 2006, it will be an accomplishment simply to DNF at my house,
three quarters of the way down the course, with my body still
functioning normally.  As 2006 winds down, I am trying to once again
find my heart's rhythm.

 <H2>
The Problem
 </H2>
</CENTER>

<p>
But I have gotten ahead of myself.  The story starts at the end of
2005, when I find that some runs don't go so well.   Sometimes I am
dizzy afterwards.  Sometimes I can't catch my breath, even standing
still.  Sometimes I am exhausted for no apparent reason.  Obviously, I'm
sick.  The symptoms recur every week or so, but seeing the medics seems
like an overreaction.  Eventually, I'll get over it.  I always do.

<p>
Then, one bright winter day while touring our garden, Becky watches
me pass out stone cold and plant myself headfirst in the daffodil bed.
For a split second, she thinks I am just joking around.  Then she sees
my face.  For a few seconds, I am lost.  The Talking Heads have lyrics
for this:
<blockquote>

And you may ask yourself, <br>
Well, How did I get here?<br><br>

There is water at the bottom of the ocean.  <br>
And water under the water.
</blockquote>

<p>
Becky screams my name from impossibly far away.   In those few
seconds, my entire universe plunges down.  My descent into medical hell
begins right there among the daffodil shoots.

<p>
I soon find myself in doctors offices, watching in bemusement as
the medics trot out equipment clearly meant for other people.  I get my
first EKG, an experience I am sure was decades in the future.  The
first few rhythm strips are normal, as is a stress test, and a bunch of
blood work.   Negative test results serve as excellent props for
someone in the state of denial.

Diagnosis, Treatment, and Failure
 </H2>

<p>
Eventually, however, rhythm strips show up that are not normal at
all.   My cardiologist paints the picture.  Just like the joke, there
is good news and there is bad news.

<p>
The bad news is that I have a heart arrhythmia - ectopic atrial
tachycardia, a variant of atrial flutter in which a group of renegade
heart cells think it's cute to pace the heart on their own.   Frankly,
they do a pretty lousy job of it.

<p>
The good news is that treatment is a snap.  Through a procedure know as
"catheter ablation", the EPs propose to toast part of my heart like a
marshmellow over a campfire, thereby teaching it a sharp lesson in the
importance of running smoothly.  Weird stuff, this medical science.
At this point, I have a hard time understanding if I am on set at
Monty Python's Flying Circus 
or in the midst of a legitimate, scientific medical process.

<p>
Naturally, I want to know why I have an arrhythmia, on the theory that
treating what might be a mere symptom might be
misdirected.   However, the cardiologists are unanimous in their
disinterest in identifying a root cause.  "Everyone always wants to know
why", one says, as if discussing a silly request from a wayward child.
I refrain from commenting that perhaps if they took some time out of
their overly busy schedules and did some research, they might be able
to answer that question instead of just brushing it off.

<p>
What the EPs do know is that 4 out of 5 people are "cured" with
ablation.  This may not sound all that reassuring, but in medical
circles, 80% counts as a serious win.   If chance favors you, you are
good to go.

<p>
Unfortunately, if you happen to be the 1 in 5, the story has a
different ending.  My first visit to the EP lab was declared a rousing
success.  The only problem was that I was back in the arrhythmia a
couple of weeks later.   No problem, according to the EPs, who proposed
toasting my  heart a tad crisper. The second visit terminated when the
EPs were unable to induce the arrhythmia on the OR table.

<p>
At this point, the story turns ugly.  Suddenly, the EPs didn't want to
have anything to do with me.  They couldn't bolt out of the OR and back
to their offices fast enough.  I had the temerity to ask for an
interview to discuss available options. An EP showed up under duress,
and treated me like the failure of the operation was my fault.  He
seemed honestly unable to understand why I would want to speak with him
following a failed operation, and he made it clear that he thought I
was wasting his time.

<p>
Becky was so furious during the interview that she crushed the tubular
arms on her metal chair.  What Becky really wanted to do was tell the
EP a few home truths about basic patient care, a dissertation he richly
deserved.  
She refrained because it hadn't yet sunk in that we
were no longer making forward progress with this particular set of
doctors, and so she wasn't ready to burn the bridges.
Instead the EP went home for the day,
confident in his knowledge that
he was doing good work, even if, regrettably,
some of his patients were morons.

Recovery
 </H2>
</CENTER>
<p>
Although roasting my heart didn't stop the arrhythmias, it did change
their pattern.  My cardiologist cautioned that things were unlikely to
improve of their own volition, but, as it turned out, that is exactly
what happened.  The episodes became far less predictable, but
also - eventually - less frequent.

<p>
I am under no illusion that I am "cured", whatever that means.  But I can
run.  For me, that's huge.  I'll take it.

<p>
In mid September, I try a 20 miler.  I'm fine afterwards.  The next week
I run another.  And the week after, another. Still fine.  As I finish
Andiamo I high-five Matt, who accompanied me on his bike. I can't quite
believe it, but the long runs are clearly independent of the
arrhythmias. In late October, I run the Marine Corps Marathon about an
hour slower than usual, mostly because my heart ran like crap during
the preceding week.  But I feel great, and even talk Bert into some
bonus miles to make up for the slow pace. The Saturday before
Thanksgiving, I run JFK in a more or less normal time, again without
problems.  In fact, I feel good the entire day, which verges on
bad manners in a 50 miler, since it is customary to work in a certain
amount of suffering somewhere along the way.

Lessons
 </H2>
</CENTER>

<p>
There is no dignity in medical hell.  I knew this from watching my
father progress through his series of cardiac issues, but it is still
different to experience it yourself. In principle, this is a solvable
problem, but I doubt that the medical establishment as a whole
will do so anytime in the foreseeable future.
To the contrary, since people stripped of their dignity are generally easier
to control, I would expect medical care to drift towards
less dignity, not more.

<p>
Doctors are just people.  Usually very busy people.  They are not
supermen, or superwomen.  If your particular medical problem fits
inside your medic's universe of knowledge, then your medics are
fabulous.  If it doesn't, they're worse than useless.  Only occasionally
did I find a doctor who was willing to look at the big picture and help me
devise strategies for coping.
These doctors have my profound gratitude.

<p>
Never underestimate the power of family support.  Neither Becky nor
Bert ever told me what I needed to do.  They just helped me to see what
was possible, and then supported my choices.

<p>
But the main lesson is much simpler:

<blockquote>
Every day is a gift.
</blockquote>

<p>
All of them.  Cold ones, hot ones, hard ones, easy ones, tough ones,
joyful ones, arrhythmic ones, normal ones.  Every single one.

<p>
I don't know what condition I'll be in tomorrow.  All I know is what I
can do with today.  So, each day, I try to make the most of it.

Release Notes
 </H3>

<p>
It took me many months to decide whether to publish this essay.  I
wrote the essay to help me come to terms with my arrhythmia.  But
sharing the result is an entirely different question.  On the one hand,
I have jealously guarded my medical privacy.  On the other, I am trying
to wrest back control of my life.  Eventually, I came to the conclusion
that private secrets bind more tightly than public stories.  In a way,
publishing this essay sets me free.  I am who - and what - I am.

<p>
It is also possible that my story will help someone else.  Heart
arrhythmias are surprisingly common, even among the very fit.  Becky
found it incredibly reassuring to learn that Stuart O'Grady, a marquee
professional bike racer from Australia, suffers from a heart
arrhythmia.
Watching O'Grady hang off the Tour de France race doctor's car with
an atrial flutter pulse in the 200 range helped us put my arrhythmia in
perspective.  
If O'Grady can make it through an arrhythmia episode and
still finish Le Grand Boucle in the hunt for the Green Jersey, then
maybe I can bang out the occasional ultramarathon in the middle of the
pack.  I definitely intend to find out.
