SWE 619 Oral Assessment Guide 4

Spring 2021

<p>
Oral Assessment 4 will focus on the second part of Liskov 5:
abstraction functions, rep-invariants, and how to argue
that a method is correct.
To make this concrete,
let's focus on specific code fragments, listed below.
You should be able to explain how changes to the 
contracts and the invariant affect correctness,
much as in-class exercise 3B.
<p>
The specific examples are:
<UL>
<LI>  <code>Poly</code>: the various constructors
<LI>  <code>Poly</code>: the <code>degree()</code> method.
<LI>  <code>Members</code>: the <code>join()</code> and <code>leave()</code>methods.
</UL>
Note:  Here, <code>Poly</code> means 
both Liskov's <code>Poly</code> and <code>MapPoly</code>.

<p>
Since I want all students to understand every week of the semester, 
it's possible that your oral assessment will address last week's topic. 
Be prepared for both!
<p>
This guide covers oral assessments
administered between Monday, February 22 and
Friday, February 26.
