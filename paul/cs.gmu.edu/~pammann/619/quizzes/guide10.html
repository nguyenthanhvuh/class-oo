SWE 619 Oral Assessment Guide 10
<br>
Spring 2021
 </h1></center>
<hr>

<p>
Oral Assessment 10 will focus on the Bloch's treatment of
<code>Object</code> class methods.
<p>
In particular, you should be able to identify
defective implementations of 
<code>equals()</code>,
<code>hashCode()</code>,
and <code>clone()</code>,
explain what's wrong,
and repair appropriately.
The assessments will be based on the examples we study in class.

<p>
Since I want all students to understand every week of the semester, 
it's possible that your oral assessment will address last week's topic. 
Be prepared for both!

<p>
This guide covers oral assessments
administered between Monday, April 5 and
Friday, April 9.
