SWE 619 Oral Assessment Guide 8

<p>
Oral Assessment 8 will focus both Liskov's treatment of polymorphism
and Bloch's treatment of lambda expressions.
<p>
To make this concrete, we'll focus on the <code>Comparator</code> interface.
You should be prepared to evaluate various implementations
of this interface against the contract for the interface,
with the ability to explain why certain violations of the contract
could lead to trouble (e.g. when used in a collection framework such as 
<code>TreeSet</code>).
You should also be prepared to manipulate this interface 
via lambda expressions (e.g. when used in a collection
framework such as <code>TreeSet</code>).
<p>
This homework should be excellent preparation.


<p>
Since I want all students to understand every week of the semester, 
it's possible that your oral assessment will address last week's topic. 
Be prepared for both!
<p>
This guide covers oral assessments
administered between Monday, March 22 and
Friday, March 26.
