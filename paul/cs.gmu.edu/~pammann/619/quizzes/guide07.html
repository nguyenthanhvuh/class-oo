SWE 619 Oral Assessment Guide 7

<p>
Oral Assessment 7 will focus on the Liskov's treatment of subtyping.
<p>
You should focus on the type of analysis required for exercise 5B.
That is, I will give you a method signature and two contracts,
one for a supertype, and one for a subtype.
As we work through variations on what's a precondition,
what's a postcondition, and what the postcondition specifies,
you should be able to state whether
Liskov's two rules for analyzing methods are satisfied and, if not, why not.


<p>
Since I want all students to understand every week of the semester, 
it's possible that your oral assessment will address last week's topic. 
Be prepared for both!
<p>
This guide covers oral assessments
administered between Monday, March 15 and
Friday, March 19.
