SWE 619 Oral Assessment Guide 3

<p>
Oral Assessment 3 will focus on the first part of Liskov 5.
You should be able to understand/explain variations of the IntSet and Poly examples.
You should be able to convert methods (both contracts
and code) in either of these classes
into the appropriate version for the "other" mutability.
(That is, immutable versions of IntSet or mutable versions of Poly.)

<p>
Since I want all students to understand every week of the semester, 
it's possible that your oral assessment will address last week's topic. 
Be prepared for both!
<p>
This guide covers oral assessments 
administered between Monday, February 15 and
Friday, February 19.
