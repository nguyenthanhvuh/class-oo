SWE 619 Oral Assessment Guide 12

Spring 2021

<hr>

Oral Assessment 12 will 
focus on the contract model in JUnit theories.
The specific examples will be variations from In-Class 11.

<p>
Since I want all students to understand every week of the semester, 
it's possible that your oral assessment will address last week's topic. 
Be prepared for both!
<p>
This guide covers oral assessments
administered between Monday, April 19 and
Friday, April 23.
