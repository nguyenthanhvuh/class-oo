SWE 619 Oral Assessment Guide 9

Spring 2021

<p>
Oral Assessment 9 will focus on Bloch's <code>Chooser</code> example.
There is a lot going on in this example.  Not only does it illustrate
many of the points Bloch makes about generics,
but it is also a good place to apply what we learned in Liskov
about analyzing data types.
Note that <code>Chooser</code>
is very similar to Liskov's <code>IntSet</code> class.


<p>
Since I want all students to understand every week of the semester, 
it's possible that your oral assessment will address last week's topic. 
Be prepared for both!
<p>
This guide covers oral assessments
administered between Monday, March 29 and
Friday, April 2.
