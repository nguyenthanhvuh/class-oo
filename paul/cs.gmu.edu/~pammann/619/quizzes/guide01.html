SWE 619 Oral Assessment Guide 1

Spring 2021

<hr>

<p>
Oral Assessment 1 will revisit the example from In-Class Exercise 0.
I'll ask you about the <b>first</b> of the two given <code>equals()</code> methods,
as well as "corner" cases where this method might do something odd.
<p>
This won't be a deep-dive; that comes later.
But you should be able to identify specific inputs that lead
to corner case behavior.
You should be able to assess
code behavior on specific inputs.
