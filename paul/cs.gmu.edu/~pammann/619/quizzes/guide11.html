SWE 619 Oral Assessment Guide 11
<br>
Spring 2021
 </h1></center>



<hr>

Oral Assessment 11 will 
focus on the Bloch Chapter 4 
with special emphasis on Item 17: Minimize mutability
and
Item 18: Favor composition over inheritance.
In particular, 
you should be prepared to apply Bloch's rules 
for making a class immutable to a simple example
and you should understand the
various aspects of Bloch's <code>InstrumentedSet</code>
example (code on page 90).


<p>
Since I want all students to understand every week of the semester, 
it's possible that your oral assessment will address last week's topic. 
Be prepared for both!
<p>
This guide covers oral assessments
administered between Monday, April 12 and
Friday, April 16.
