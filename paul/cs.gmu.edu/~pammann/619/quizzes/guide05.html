SWE 619 Oral Assessment Guide 5

Spring 2021

<p>
Oral Assessment 5 will focus on the Liskov's treatment of iteration abstraction
and Bloch Chapter 8, especially item 50.
<p>
For the oral assessment,
you should focus on the iteration examples from in-class exercise 4A.
(Exercise 4B is the focus of the homework.)

<p>
Since I want all students to understand every week of the semester, 
it's possible that your oral assessment will address last week's topic. 
Be prepared for both!
<p>
This guide covers oral assessments
administered between Monday, March 1 and
Friday, March 5.
