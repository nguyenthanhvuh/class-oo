SWE 619 Oral Assessment Guide 2

Spring 2021

<hr>

Oral Assessment 2 will focus on Liskov, Chapters 3-4 and Bloch 10.
Specifically, you should be able to explain
the code and the contracts for in-Class exercise 1A.
As part of this, you should be able to transform preconditions
into postconditions via the exception handling mechanism,
and you should be able to incorporate Bloch's advice on
exceptions into this transformation.
<P>
Since I want all students to understand every week of the semester,
it's possible that your oral assessment will address
last week's topic.  Be prepared for both!
