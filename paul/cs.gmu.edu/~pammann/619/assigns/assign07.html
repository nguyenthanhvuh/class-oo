<b>Assignment:</b>
<p>

A <code>Comparator</code> based on absolute values is problematic.
Code up the comparator and then write client
code that illustrates the problem.
Use a Java 8 <i>lambda function</i> implement the comparator.
Explain what is wrong in a brief summary statement.
Your explanation of the problem must be phrased in terms of 
a violation of
the contract for <code>Comparator</code>.
<p>
To emphasize that this contract problem is real,
your code should create two Java sets,
one a <code>HashSet</code>,
and the other a <code>TreeSet</code>.
The <code>TreeSet</code> should order items
with your absolute value comparator.
Your example should add the same integers
to both sets, yet still end up with sets that are different.
Your summary statement should explain why.
<p>
As for other recent assignments,
your deliverable is a clear, concise story
that demonstrates completion of the assignment.
