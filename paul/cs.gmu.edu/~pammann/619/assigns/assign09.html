<b>Goal:</b>
<code>Object</code> class contracts.
<P>
As it happens,  Liskov's implementation of <code>clone()</code>
for the <code>IntSet</code> class (see figure 5.10, page 97)
is wrong.
<UL>
	<LI> Use the 
		<a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~pammann/619/inClass/IntSet.java">version</a>
		of <code>IntSet</code>
		from the in-class exercise.
		Implement a subtype of IntSet
		to demonstrate the problem.
		Your solution should include appropiate executable code
		in the form of JUnit tests.
	<LI> Provide a correct implementation of <code>clone()</code>
		for IntSet.
		Again, give appropriate JUnit tests.
	<LI> Correctly override <code>hashCode()</code> 
		and <code>equals()</code>.	
		As discussed in the class exercise, 
		the standard recipe is not appropriate in this (unusual) case.
	<LI> In addititon to code and tests, your deliverable is a <b>story</b>.
		Explain what is going on at each stage of the exercise.
		The GTA will primarily grade your story.
