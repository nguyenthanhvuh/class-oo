<p>
<b>Goal:</b>
Immutablity via Bloch Item 50.
<P>
Revisit the <code>Period</code> example
<a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/~pammann/619/inClass/inClass04B.html">In-Class 4B</a>.
<P>
Implement a satisfying solution to question 3.
That is, you should not only break the immutability of the <code>Period</code>
class by writing a suitable sublcass, 
but you should also develop a plausible case where a client
ends up "in trouble" due to the loss of immutability.
<P>
Turn in a <b>story</b>.
Grading is in part the technical aspect of breaking immutability,
and in part that your client case is plausible.
