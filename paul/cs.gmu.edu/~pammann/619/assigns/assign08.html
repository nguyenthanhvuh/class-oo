<p>
<b>Goal:</b>
Generics<BR>
<P>
Consider the 
<a href = "../code/BoundedQueue.java">BoundedQueue</a> 
example from in-class exercise #8C.
<P>
Complete the generic part of the exercise:  The result
should be fully generic, and there should not be any compiler warnings.
You should adopt Bloch's advice about lists vs. arrays;
doing so
will eliminate the need for many of the instance variables.
<P>
Keep the same methods, but update the behavior (and document with contracts!)
to include exception handling for all cases not on the happy path.
<br>
Include the constructor in your considerations.
In particular, consider whether you think a zero-sized buffer is a reasonable possibility.
Document your reasoning.
This is less about a right vs. wrong answer than a careful consideration
of the consequences of the decision.
<!--
<P>
Implement <code>repOk()</code> and <code>toString()</code>.
(Note that adopting Bloch's advice has the beneficial side
effect of greatly simplifying the rep-invariant.)
-->
<P>
Add <code>putAll()</code> and <code>getAll()</code>.
Define the method signatures carefully.
Use exception-handling consistent with that for <code>get()</code> and <code>put()</code>.
Use bounded wildcards as appropriate.
Note that <code>putAll()</code> has a special case where there isn't
sufficient space in the bounded queue.  Adopt a solution you think
Bloch and/or Liskov would approve of.
In particular, Bloch prefers that when methods throw exceptions,
there is no change to the state of the object.
<P>
As before, turn in a clear, concise <i>story</i> demonstrating completion of the assignment.
