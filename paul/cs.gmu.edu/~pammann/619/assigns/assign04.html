<p>
<b>Goal:</b>
Rep-Invariants, contracts, tests.<BR>

Revisit the <b>mutable</b> <code>Poly</code> 
example from assignment 3.
That is, use the one based on a map, not an array.

<OL>
<LI> Implement <code>repOk()</code>.
<LI> Introduce a fault (i.e. "bug") that breaks the rep-invariant.
	Try to do this with a small (conceptual) change to the code.
	Show that the rep-invariant is broken with a JUnit test.
<LI>
	Analyzed your bug with respect to the various contracts/methods
	in Poly. Are all/some/none of the contracts violated?
<LI>
	Do you think your fault is realistic?  Why or why not?
</OL>
<p>
        As in assignment 3, your deliverable is a <b>story</b>,
	with exactly the same rationale.
	Take screenshots (e.g. of failing JUnit tests) 
	as necessary to make your case.
<P>

Grading:
<UL>
<LI> Correctness of solution
<LI> Clarity of story
<UL>

Note:  If your group had trouble with the previous assignment, 
feel free to appeal to your classmates to post a sample
solution on Piazza.
