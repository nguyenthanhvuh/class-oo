<b>Goal:</b>
Contracts <BR>
<br>
For the second assignment, you'll build a <em>very</em> small piece of Java
for a contract with preconditions,
transform the contract so that all preconditions become postconditions,
and then re-implement appropriately.

<p>
Consider a method that calculates the number of months
needed to pay off a loan of a given size at
a fixed <i>annual</i> interest rate and a fixed <i>monthly</i> payment.
For instance, a $100,000 loan at an 8% annual rate would
take 166 months to discharge at a monthly payment of $1,000,
and 141 months to discharge at a monthly payment of $1,100.
(In both of these cases, the final payment is smaller than the others;
I rounded  165.34 up to 166 and 140.20 up to 141.)
Continuing the example, the loan would never be
paid off at a monthly payment of $100, since
the principal would grow rather than shrink.
<br>
Define a Java class called <code>Loan</code>.
In that class, write a method that satisfies the following specification:
<pre>
   @param principal:  Amount of the initial principal
   @param rate:       Annual interest rate  (8% rate expressed as rate = 0.08)
   @param payment:    Amount of the monthly payment

   public static int months (int principal, double rate, int payment)
   
   Requires: principal, rate, and payment all positive 
            and payment is sufficiently large to drive the principal to zero.
   Effects:  return the number of months required to pay off the principal
</pre>

<p>
Note that the precondition is quite strong, which makes implementing
the method easy.  
You should use double precision arithmetic internally,
but the final result is an integer, not a floating point value.
The key step in your calculation is to change the principal on
each iteration with the following formula (which amounts
to monthly compounding):
<pre>
    newPrincipal = oldPrincipal * (1 + monthlyInterestRate) - payment;
</pre>
The variable names here are explanatory, not required.
You may want to use different variables, which is fine.
<p>
<b>
To make sure you understand the point about preconditions, 
your code is required to be minimal. 
Specifically, if it possible to delete parts of your implementation 
and still have it satisfy the requirements, you'll earn less than full credit.
</b>

<p>

Now modify <code>months</code>
so that it handles <b>all</b> of its preconditions with exceptions.
Use the standard exceptions recommended by Bloch.
Document this with a revised contract.
You can use JavaDoc or you can simply identify the postconditions.
