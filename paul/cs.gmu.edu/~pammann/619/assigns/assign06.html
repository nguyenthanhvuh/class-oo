<b>Goal:</b>
Type Abstraction.<BR>
<P>

Consider the following market class.
<pre>
class Market {
   private Set&lt;Item&gt; wanted;           // items for which prices are of interest
   private Bag&lt;Item, Money&gt; offers;    // offers to sell items at specific prices
   // Note:  Bag isn't a Java data type.  Here, the bag entries are pairs.

   public void offer (Item item, Money price)
      // Requires: item is an element of wanted
      // Effects:  add (item, price) to offers
   
   public Money buy(Item item)
      // Requires: item is an element of the domain of offers
      // Effects: choose and remove some (arbitrary) pair (item, price) from
      //          offers and return the chosen price
}
</pre>

<OL>
<LI>
Suppose that offers are only accepted if they are lower than previous offers.
<pre>
class Low_Bid_Market extends Market {
   public void offer (Item item, Money price)
      // Requires: item is an element of wanted
      // Effects:  if (item, price) is not cheaper than any existing pair
      //           (item, existing_price) in offers do nothing
      //           else add (item, price) to offers
</pre>
<br>
Is <code>Low_Bid_Market</code> a valid subtype of <code>Market</code>?
Appeal to the methods rule to back up your answer.
<LI>
Suppose that the <code>buy()</code> method always chooses the lowest price on an item.
<pre>
class Low_Offer_Market extends Market {
   public Money buy(Item item)
      // Requires: item is an element the domain of offers
      // Effects: choose and remove pair (item, price) with the 
      //          lowest price from offers and return the chosen price
</pre>
<br>
Is <code>Low_Offer_Market</code> a valid subtype of <code>Market</code>?
Appeal to the methods rule to back up your answer.

</OL>
Note: This is purely a "paper and pencil" exercise.  No
	code is required.
Write your answer so that it is easily understandable by
someone with only a passing knowledge of Liskov's rules for subtypes.
