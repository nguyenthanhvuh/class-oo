<b>Goal:</b>
Applying lessons learned.
 <BR>

You have a choice of possible assignments.
<br>
<br>
<p>
In each case, the deliverable is a <em>story</em>.
Write a brief report,
and include enough evidence
(output, screen shots, etc.)
that the GTA can figure out that you actually completed the assignment.

<LI>
Consider one of the <code>copyOf()</code> methods in the java 
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html">
Arrays</a> utility class.
Bloch uses this method in his <code>Stack</code> example.
Code a corresponding method in C++, changing the argument list as necessary.
Provide a specification for the C++ code by
translating the JavaDoc and adding preconditions as necessary.
Explain what this exercise demonstrates about C++ type safety.
<LI>
For most of the semester, we have focused on
design considerations for constructing software
that does something we want it to do.
For this last assignment, I would like students
to appreciate just how vulnerable software is
to malicious parties intent on attacking their
software.
Students who find this assignment amusing might
wish to take ISA/SWE 681: Secure Software Design and Programming.
<P>

There are two attacks documented in Bloch's 
Item 88: <i>Write <code>readObject()</code> methods defensively.</i>
One is called <code>BogusPeriod</code>,
and the other is called <code>MutablePeriod</code>.
Implement either (your choice) of these attacks (basically involves
typing in code from Bloch) and verify that the attack takes place.

<LI>
A different source of security vulnerabilities in Java also involve
serialization.
Bloch (and others) recommend "cross-platform
structured data representations" (e.g. JSON or Protocol Buffers) 
as safe alternatives.
Develop a simple serialization example in Java and convert it
into a safe alternative (probably, JSON is easier to use, since
it is text-based).
To make the example more interesting, use some objects types that
are not directly supported.

<LI> Find some existing (Java) code that uses the "int enum pattern"
and refactor it to use Java Enums instead.
Identify any type-safety issue you uncover in the existing code.
To make the exercise interesting, 
extend your enums beyond simple named-constants
in one of the ways discussed by Bloch in Item 34.


<br>
<LI>
  Where appropriate, code up, as JUnit theories, constraints 
  for classes that implement the Java <code>Comparable</code> interface.
  Note that there is significant overlap with the in-class exercise.
  Note also that the <code>Comparable</code> interface is generic;
  hence, you should use generics in your JUnit test class.
<LI>
  Gain experience with one of the property-based testing
tools.  I suggest a Java-based one (such as jqwik).  One
way to do this is work through one of the articles linked
on the jqwik site.
