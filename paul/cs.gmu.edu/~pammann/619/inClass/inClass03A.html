Consider Liskov's immutable Poly example, where an abstract Poly
is defined as c0 + c1x + c2x^2 + ...,
and is implemented with one variable:
<pre>
   private Map&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; map;
</pre>
Fill in example values that are mapped by the abstraction function.
<pre>
Abstract State: Poly

Representation State: map
</pre>
<OL>
<LI>
Identify representation states that should not be mapped.
<LI>
Try to capture these states with a rule (that is, a rep-invariant).
<LI>
Consider implementing the <code>degree()</code> method.
What code would do the job?
What more specific type of map would make the implementation simpler?
