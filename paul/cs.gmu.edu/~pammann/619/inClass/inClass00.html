<em>Instructions</em>:  Work with your group.
Your group assignment is on Piazza.
(You might decide to change groups later, but for today,
stick with this group.)
When we invoke the BB break-out function, nagivate to your assigned
group.  (Yes, this is nuts from a usability perspective, but it's BB.)

<OL>
<LI> Your group should spend a few minutes
getting acquainted.
Explain a bit about yourself:  full-time student?,
working in software development?,
why are you taking this class?,
favorite/least favorite thing about writing software?, etc.
<LI>
Decide on a mechanism for joint communication.  Google docs?
IDE with screen share?  Something else?

</OL>

Now address a technical topic.



This exercise touches on
some of the thorny issues in data abstraction and inheritance.
There is a lot going on in this example.
Hence
don't worry if it seems confusing today.
We'll revisit this example several times over the course of the semester.

<p>
Consider the following (textbook) code:
<pre>
public class User {
    private String name;
    public User (String name) { this.name = name; }
    @Override public boolean equals (Object obj) {
       if (!(obj instanceof User)) return false;
       return ((User) obj).name.equals(this.name);
    }
    // other methods omitted
}
public class SpecialUser extends User {
    private int id;
    public SpecialUser (String name, int id) { super(name); this.id = id; }
    @Override public boolean equals (Object obj) {
       if (!(obj instanceof SpecialUser)) return false;
       return super.equals(obj) && ((SpecialUser) obj).id == this.id;
    }
    // other methods omitted
}
</pre>
<OL>
<LI> Walk though the execution of the 
<code>equals()</code> method
in class <code>User</code> for a few well-chosen objects as the parameter.
What happens at each point in the execution?
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
<LI> What does it mean for an <code>equals()</code> implementation
to be <b>correct</b>?  How do you know?
Be as concrete as you can. 
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
<LI> Is the given implementation of <code>equals()</code>
in class <code>User</code> correct?
Again, be concrete.
If there is a problem, find a specific object (test case!) that demonstrates the problem.
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
<LI> How does inheritance complicate the correctness
discussion for <code>equals()</code> 
in class <code>SpecialUser</code>?
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
<LI> What is your assessment of the <code>equals()</code>
method in the <code>SpecialUser</code> class?
</OL>
