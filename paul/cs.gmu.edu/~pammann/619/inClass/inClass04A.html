Consider the Java Iterator&lt;E&gt; interface:
<pre>
   public boolean hasNext();
   public E next() throws NoSuchElementException
   public void remove() throws IllegalStateException
</pre>
<UL>
<LI>
What is the abstract state of an iterator without the <code>remove()</code> method?
<br> <br>
<LI>
Work through an example iterating over a list of strings:  ["bat", "cat", "dog"]
<br> <br>
<LI>
What is the abstract state of an iterator with a <code>previous()</code> method?
<br> <br>
<LI>
What is the abstract state of an iterator with the <code>remove()</code> method?
<br> <br>
<LI>
Design an immutable version of the iterator.
<br> <br>
<UL>
<LI>
How is <code>hasNext()</code> handled?
<br> <br>
<LI>
How is <code>next()</code> handled?
<br> <br>
<LI>
How is <code>remove()</code> handled?
<br> <br>
</UL>
<LI>
Exercise the immutable iterator with some sample client code.
</UL>
<br> <br>
<!--
Suppose we writing tests for the <code>Iterator</code> interface based on the JavaDoc
specifications.  Note the precondition.
<UL>
<LI>
At a minimum which tests does <code>hasNext()</code> require?
<br> <br>
<LI>
At a minimum which tests does <code>next()</code> require?
<br> <br>
<LI>
At a minimum which tests does <code>remove()</code> require?
<br> <br>
<LI>
In standard Java Collection structures, what has been done to the precondition?
<br> <br>
</UL>
