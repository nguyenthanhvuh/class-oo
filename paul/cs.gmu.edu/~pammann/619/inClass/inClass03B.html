Consider the code:
<pre>
public class Members {
    // Members is a mutable record of organization membership
    // AF: Collect the list as a set
    // rep-inv1: members != null
    // rep-inv2: members != null && no duplicates in members
    // for simplicity, assume null can be a member...

    List&lt;Person&gt; members;   // the representation

    //  Post: person becomes a member
    public void join (Person person) { members.add   (person);}

    //  Post: person is no longer a member
    public void leave(Person person) { members.remove(person);}
</pre>

</pre>

<LI>
Does <code>join()</code> maintain rep-inv?
<LI>
Does <code>join()</code> satisfy contract?
<LI>
Does <code>leave()</code> maintain rep-inv?
<LI>
Does <code>leave()</code> satisfy contract?
</UL>

Analyze these 4 questions for rep-inv 1.
<br><br>
<LI>
Repeat for rep-inv 2.
<br><br>
<LI>
Recode <code>join()</code>
to make the verification go through.
Which rep-invariant do you use?

<LI>
Recode <code>leave()</code>
to make the verification go through.
Which rep-invariant do you use?
