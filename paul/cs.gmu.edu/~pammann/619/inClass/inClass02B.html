Consider Liskov's Poly example, where an abstract Poly
is defined as c0 + c1x + c2x^2 + ...,
and is implemented with two variables:
<pre>
   private int deg;
   private int[] trms;
</pre>
Fill in example values that are mapped by the abstraction function.
<pre>
Abstract Poly State:


What is a "state"?
A "state" is an assigment of values to variables


 AF
/|\
 |         5 + 3x^2
 |
 |
 |----------------------------------------------------------
 |
 |
 |
 |        (-10, null)

             (2, [5,0,3,0])  Liskov says "no"

             (2, [5,0,3])  Liskov says "yes"

The "rep-invariant" describes which rep states are "yes"
1) trms != null
2) deg >= 0
3) deg = trms.length - 1
4) and more - see Liskov

The rep-invariant defines the domain of the abstraction function



Representation State: (deg, trms)
</pre>
<OL>
<LI>
Identify representation states that should not be mapped.
<LI>
Try to capture these states with a rule (that is, a rep-invariant).
<LI>
Devise a representation that is suitable for a mutable version of Poly.
<LI>
Develop a rep-invariant for that representation.
