This is a JUnit theory exercise.

<OL>
<LI>
Write a JUnit theory that captures the symmetry property of the 
<code>equals()</code> method.
<LI>
Create <code>@DataPoints</code>
from Bloch's <code>Point</code>,
<code>ColorPoint</code> classes.
So that we're all on the same page, 
create 1 <code>null</code> reference, 1 <code> Point</code> object
and 2 <code>ColorPoint</code> objects.
<LI>
Given this set of data points: 
<UL>
<LI> How many combinations are considered by the theory?
<LI> How many combinations make it past the preconditions of the theory?
<LI> How many combinations make it to the postcondition of the theory?
</UL>
<LI>
What happens to this theory and the accompanying data points 
when favoring composition over inheritance?
<LI>
Repeat the exercise for the transitive property for <code>equals()</code>.

<LI>
Recall the <code>equals()</code> and 
<code>hashCode()</code> discussion in Bloch.
Write a JUnit theory that encodes the consistency
property between  <code>equals()</code> and <code>hashCode()</code>.
<LI>
Build a toy example that violates the theory.
Fix the toy example so that the theory is no longer violated.
<LI>
Consider the <code>Comparable</code> interface:
what properties should be checked with theories?
</OL>
