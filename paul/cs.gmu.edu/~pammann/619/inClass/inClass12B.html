This is a recap exercise based on the map-based implementation
of Liskov's polynomial example:
<a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~pammann/619/code/MapPoly.java">MapPoly</a>


<p>
<OL>
<LI> How are the following polynomials represented?
<UL>
<LI> 0
<LI> 3-7x^4
</UL>

<LI> Bloch would not accept that the <code>MapPoly</code> class 
is immutable.
Why not?  
Show how it would be possible to provide mutable behavior
with the class if Bloch's problem isn't fixed.
Fix the problem, and implement any other changes Bloch suggests,
even if they don't compromise immutability in this particular example.

<LI>Write a reasonable rep-invariant  for <code>MapPoly</code>.
How would this rep-invariant change if the zero Poly had
an alternate representation.

<LI> Provide reasonable implementations of <code>equals()</code> 
and <code>hashCode()</code>.
Explain why you believe your implemetations are appropriate.

<LI> As written, the contract for the <code>coeff()</code> method
is inconsistent with other contracts in the class.
<UL>
<LI> What is the inconsistency with the contract?
<LI> Fix the inconsistency with the contract.
<LI> Fix the code to match the revised contract.
</UL>

<LI> Argue that the implementation of the <code>coeff()</code> method is correct
(with respect to your repaired contract, of course.)

<LI> Consider implementing  <code>Cloneable</code> for this class.
Decide whether Bloch would think this is a good idea
and provide justification for your answer.
Note:  You don't have to actually implement anything for this question.

<LI>
See if you can come up with a theory about Polys and implement it
in JUnit.  (Polys are math objects, so there should be theories!)
Here's a suggestion:  Think about the relationship between the degrees
of two Polys being multiplied and the resulting degree.
