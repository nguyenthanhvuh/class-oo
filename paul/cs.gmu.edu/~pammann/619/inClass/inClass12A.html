Consider the following (bad) Java,
implementing the "C style" enum pattern:
<pre>
public class Coins {
   public static final int PENNY = 1;
   public static final int NICKLE = 5;
   public static final int DIME = 10;
   public static final int QUARTER = 25;
}
</pre>
<OL>
	<LI> Give example code that illustrates a type safety problem with 
	<code>Coins</code>.   Work through a range of expressions from 
	"probably ok" to "clearly wrong".
<br> <br>
	<LI> What code would you need to turn a nickel into a string?
	Explain how this could go wrong at runtime.
<br> <br>
	<LI> What code would you need to iterate through the coins?
<br> <br>
	<LI> Would extensions to this particular enum be likely to require
	recompilation of client code?  Explain.
<br> <br>
	<LI> Write a decent Java Enum for coins.
<br> <br>
	<LI> Turn a nickle into a string.
<br> <br>
	<LI> Iterate though the coins.
<br> <br>
</OL>
Consider Bloch's example:
<pre>
// Abuse of ordinal to derive an associated value – DON’T DO THIS
public enum Ensemble {
   SOLO,   DUET,   TRIO,  QUARTET, QUINTET, 
   SEXTET, SEPTET, OCTET, NONET,   DECTET;

   public int numberOfMusicians() { return ordinal() + 1; }
}
</pre>
Explain why it's wrong, fix it,
and add another enum with an overlapping number of musicians.
