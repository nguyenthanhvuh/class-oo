    "# Polymorphic Abstractions\n",
    "> Liskov 8\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "- We have seen collections of objects of the same type (e.g., list of integers, list of strings)\n",
    "  - Rather limited because we can only store objects of the same type\n",
    "  - Would be better to define the collection type just *once* and use it for *any type of object*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Polymorphism Abstraction**: the solution\n",
    "  - the ability to write code that can work with objects of multiple types\n",
    "  - Polymorphism generalizes abstractions so that they work for many types\n",
    "     - e.g., `Vector` is polymorphic to its element.\n",
    "- Allows us to avoid having to redefine abstractions when we want to use them for more types; instead, a single abstraction becomes much more widely useful.\n",
    "  - Examples:\n",
    "    - A procedure can be polymorphic with respect to the types of one or more arguments. \n",
    "       - E.g., `sort` can sort any list of comparable elements.\n",
    "       - `Iterator` can iterate over any type of collection\n",
    "    - A data abstraction can be polymorphic with respect to the types of elements its objects contain. \n",
    "       - E.g., `Vector` can contain any type of object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fig 8.1 (Liskov 8.1) provides the specs of `Set` as polymorphic abstraction\n",
    "    - Specs of `Set` is similar to `IntSet` but `Set`'s methods (e.g., `insert` and `isInt`) take `Object` as argument (instead of `int`)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Equality Revisited\n",
    "- Several ways to define equality\n",
    "  - **Object identity**: two objects are equal if they are the same object `A==B`\n",
    "  - **Object state**: two objects are equal if they have the same state `A.counter == B.counter`. E.g., \n",
    "  - **Object property**: two objects are equal if they have the same property `A.isEven() == B.isEven()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issues with equality checking over objects that store **mutable** data\n",
    "- Example: Storing mutable types `Vector` in a `Set`\n",
    "    ```java\n",
    "        //insert an object into a set\n",
    "        void insert (Object x) {\n",
    "            for all elements in collection{\n",
    "                if (element[i].equals(x)) return; // no duplicates\n",
    "            } \n",
    "            collection.addElement(x);\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```java\n",
    "        Set s = new HashSet(); \n",
    "        Vector x = new Vector(); \n",
    "        Vector y = new Vector();\n",
    "        s.insert(x);\t\t// s has 1 element \n",
    "        s.insert(y);\t\t// s still has 1 element \n",
    "        s.contain(y)        // returns true     \n",
    "        x.add(3)   ;        // mutate x\n",
    "        s.contain(y);       // return false    \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- One solution is using **immutable** objects\n",
    "    - e.g., create an immutable `Container` object to store Vector and override `equals` method\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```java\n",
    "        Set s = new Set( );\n",
    "        Vector x = new Vector();\n",
    "        Vector y = new Vector();\n",
    "        s.insert(new Container(x)); //s has 1 item\n",

    "        - However, the syntax of anonymous classes is bulky considering that the `CheckPerson` interface contains only one method. \n",

    "**Overview**: In this module we will learn about classes and interfaces, the heart of Java and many other OO language and the basic units of abstraction. We will learn guidelines that can help us make usable, robust, and flexible classes and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Item 15: Minimize the accessibility of classes and members\n",
    "\n",
    "- Information hiding is good:\n",
    "    - It decouples the components of a system, it ensures that no other component is modifying the state of your components. This allows components to be *developed, tested, optimized, used, understood, and modified in isolation*\n",
    "        - This speeds up system development because *components can be developed in parallel*\n",
    "    - This *increases software reuse because components that are decoupled are often useful in other contexts*\n",
    "    - If you make a class *public, you are obligated to support it forever* to maintain backward compatibility, i.e., *not break existing client code*\n",
    "    - So, should make all members *private, but if need be, make them package-private*\n",
    "        - Package-private: default, no access control keyword, part of the internal implementation\n",
    "        - *private* and *package-private* members are not visible to the external clients\n",
    "    - *Why not make them protected?*\n",
    "        - A *protected* member is part of the class's exported API and must be *supported forever* (subclassing).\n",
    "        - Also, protected members could be made publicly accessible via subclassing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If a method overrides a superclass method, it cannot have a more restrictive access level in the subclass than in the superclass… prevented by the compiler\n",
    "    - Client code is written in the context of the superclass, \n",
    "        - you cannot prevent method access later on\n",
    "    - This is necessary to ensure that an instance of the subclass is usable anywhere that an instance of the superclass is usable (the Liskov substitution principle):\n",
    "        - if `A.foo()` is public, `B.foo()` cannot be private.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The above is applicable to method overriding. Is below allowed?\n",
    "    ```java\n",
    "        class A{\n",
    "            public int x;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        class B extends A {\n",
    "            private int x;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - Yes, these are different variables (no overriding!)\n",
    "\n",
    "- To facilitate testing your code, it might be acceptable to change a *private member* to *package-private* to test it, but no higher\n",
    "  - So tests can be made to be part of the package being tested\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Why making instance fields public is bad?*\n",
    "  - You should never change the *name and type* of a public field\n",
    "  - Public mutable fields are bad for *thread-safety*\n",
    "  - If an instance field is non-final or is a reference to a mutable object, then by making it public, *you give up the ability to enforce invariants* involving the field\n",
    "\n",
    "- *static fields of public classes could be made public*, but must be *final* and contain either primitive values (immutables) or references to immutable objects \n",
    "- Is it OK to make a static field public + final + references an array?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `public static final Thing[] VALUES = { ... };  // What could go wrong?`\n",
    "  - VALUES is final; entries in VALUES are not!\n",
    "\n",
    "- To fix the problem, you can make the public array private and add a public immutable list:\n",
    "    ```java\n",
    "        private static final Thing[] PRIVATE_VALUES = { ... };\n",
    "        public static final List<Thing> VALUES = Collections.unmodifiableList(Arrays.asList(PRIVATE_VALUES));\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternatively, you can make the array private and add a public method that returns a clone of it:\n",
    "    ```java\n",
    "        private static final Thing[] PRIVATE_VALUES = { ... };\n",
    "        public static final Thing[] values() {\n",
    "                return PRIVATE_VALUES.clone();\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "### Item 16: In public classes, use accessor methods, not public fields\n",
    "    - Avoid code such as:  `class Point { public double x; public double y; }`\n",
    "    - Why? See item 15\n",
    "    - Also, public mutable fields are *not* thread safe\n",
    "    - Use get/set methods instead: `public double getX() { return x; }  public void setX(double x) { this.x = x}`\n",
    "    - Advice holds for immutable fields as well. But why? They are thread-safe…\n",
    "  - Limits possible ways for class to evolve\n",
    "\n",
    "- *It is never OK to have public fields in public classes:*\n",
    "  - if a class is public, make the fields private or package-private then provide accessor methods; this preserves the flexibility to change the class’s internal representation\n",
    "  - *If a class is package-private*, there is nothing wrong with exposing its data fields. The client could never see it. Also, If a method is declared with default access, it can only be overridden by methods in the same package\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Item 18: Favor composition over inheritance\n",
    "- When is it is safe to use inheritance?\n",
    "  - Within a package, where the subclass and the superclass implementations are under the control of the same programmers\n",
    "  - When extending classes are specifically designed and documented for extension, e.g., interface inheritance\n",
    "  -  Recall adding significant attributes might mess up the equality contract!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inheritance violates encapsulation:\n",
    " - A subclass depends on the implementation details of its superclass\n",
    " - A subclass might need to know the implementation of the superclass (see example next)\n",
    " - If the superclass changes, the subclass may break, even though its code has not been touched\n",
    " - Therefore, a subclass must evolve in tandem with its superclass, unless the superclass’s authors have designed it specifically for the purpose of being extended\n",
    " - Difficult for superclass to maintain invariants in face of malicious/careless subclass (mutability lecture)\n",
