    "# Polymorphic Abstractions\n",
    "> Liskov 8\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "- We have seen collections of objects of the same type (e.g., list of integers, list of strings)\n",
    "  - Rather limited because we can only store objects of the same type\n",
    "  - Would be better to define the collection type just *once* and use it for *any type of object*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Polymorphism Abstraction**: the solution\n",
    "  - the ability to write code that can work with objects of multiple types\n",
    "  - Polymorphism generalizes abstractions so that they work for many types\n",
    "     - e.g., `Vector` is polymorphic to its element.\n",
    "- Allows us to avoid having to redefine abstractions when we want to use them for more types; instead, a single abstraction becomes much more widely useful.\n",
    "  - Examples:\n",
    "    - A procedure can be polymorphic with respect to the types of one or more arguments. \n",
    "       - E.g., `sort` can sort any list of comparable elements.\n",
    "       - `Iterator` can iterate over any type of collection\n",
    "    - A data abstraction can be polymorphic with respect to the types of elements its objects contain. \n",
    "       - E.g., `Vector` can contain any type of object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fig 8.1 (Liskov 8.1) provides the specs of `Set` as polymorphic abstraction\n",
    "    - Specs of `Set` is similar to `IntSet` but `Set`'s methods (e.g., `insert` and `isInt`) take `Object` as argument (instead of `int`)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Equality Revisited\n",
    "- Several ways to define equality\n",
    "  - **Object identity**: two objects are equal if they are the same object `A==B`\n",
    "  - **Object state**: two objects are equal if they have the same state `A.counter == B.counter`. E.g., \n",
    "  - **Object property**: two objects are equal if they have the same property `A.isEven() == B.isEven()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issues with equality checking over objects that store **mutable** data\n",
    "- Example: Storing mutable types `Vector` in a `Set`\n",
    "    ```java\n",
    "        //insert an object into a set\n",
    "        void insert (Object x) {\n",
    "            for all elements in collection{\n",
    "                if (element[i].equals(x)) return; // no duplicates\n",
    "            } \n",
    "            collection.addElement(x);\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```java\n",
    "        Set s = new HashSet(); \n",
    "        Vector x = new Vector(); \n",
    "        Vector y = new Vector();\n",
    "        s.insert(x);\t\t// s has 1 element \n",
    "        s.insert(y);\t\t// s still has 1 element \n",
    "        s.contain(y)        // returns true     \n",
    "        x.add(3)   ;        // mutate x\n",
    "        s.contain(y);       // return false    \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- One solution is using **immutable** objects\n",
    "    - e.g., create an immutable `Container` object to store Vector and override `equals` method\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```java\n",
    "        Set s = new Set( );\n",
    "        Vector x = new Vector();\n",
    "        Vector y = new Vector();\n",
    "        s.insert(new Container(x)); //s has 1 item\n",

    "        x.add(new Integer(3));  // x is mutated\n",

You would have to rewrite a lot of your API to accommodate this change. \n",
    "        - In addition, this approach is unnecessarily restrictive; what if you wanted to print members younger than a certain age, for example?\n",

    "        - Although this method is more generic, trying to create a separate method for each possible search query can still lead to brittle code. \n",
    "        - You can instead separate the code that specifies the criteria for which you want to search in a different class.\n",

    "    - **Limitation**\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "    - **Limitation**\n",
    "        - This approach reduces the amount of code required because you don't have to create a new class for each search that you want to perform. \n",
    "        - However, the syntax of anonymous classes is bulky considering that the `CheckPerson` interface contains only one method. \n",
    "        - In this case, you can use a lambda expression instead of an anonymous class, as described in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
