What does it mean to write correct software?
- It conforms to some expectation (software contracts or specificaions)
- Should pass its testsuite  ..
- Should not have exception or performance issues


- Specifications/contracts (requirements)
- Should not have exception or error

- Performance, maintainable, expandable :  desired qualities , but not
required for *correctness*


f (x, y):   // return output = x  / y
   //precond:  x,y are reals

  if y == 0:  raise exception
  ...




preconditions
- x,y are reals
- y != 0
- x >= 0
- x >=  100
- we want preconditions are are as WEAK as possible
   1. x could be any real numbers
   2. x must be non-negative
   3. x must be >= 100

3 is stronger than 2 is stronger 1
the best precondition is the weakest one, i.e., TRUE  (the function
has no assumption on the input)


- output : number
- output ~   x /y    (output * y   ~= x)

- precondition/requirements:  a condition over the inputs ,
assumptions that we make when the function starts
   - x,y being real numbers
   - y != 0

- postcondition/behaviors:  behavior of the function (the program),
relationshp btw inputs and outputs

   1. output is a number (reals,... )     weaker
   2. output * y ~= x                     stronger

   the best postcondition is the strongest one,  i.e.,   output * y ~= x

- side-effects:
   - can change input X, ....


task: sorting a list of numbers in ascending order  (e.g., 1,5,10,...)

g(l):
  //precondition: a list of numbers
  //same data types (comparable)
  //iterable ...
  //finite

  // l is arraylist of integers
  // precondition over l:   none,  true

   postcondition:
   - |l| == |l'|
   - l' same datatype  as l
   - [1,2,1,2]   [1,1,1,2]
   - l' is a permutation of l
   - l' ascending order


 //sort l in ascending order
 return l'




type checking

- void f (int x, int y){
   int o = 3;
   return o;
}

type-checker is light-weight analysis

assertion(y = x**2);





- side-effects
