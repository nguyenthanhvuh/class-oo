testing vs verfication
- testing:  test if the program works over a *finite* number of inputs
- verification: formally/mathematically show/guarantee that a program works over *all possible* inputs
  - Nasa rovers
  - A318: formally proved that no floating pt errs
  - robotic surgical arms



Precondition (P):
  - client/customer: establish  P
Postcondition (Q)
  - developer/implementation:  establish Q under assumption that P is established


- If a program is not correct
  - if precondition is wrong: blame client
  - if (precondition is met) postcondition is wrong: blame developer


- sqrt example  :  y = sqrt(x)
  preconditions:
  - x > 0 (preferred)
  - x >= 0 (preferred)
  - x is an integer (preferred)
  - 100 <= x  <= 200  (not preferred)
  - x = 101  (not preferred)

  - best precondition: no precondition
  
  postconditions:
  - y is a number
  - y <= x
  - y*y == x (-/+ epsilon)   ~~ y = x/y  (preferred)



- partial vs total specification
  - partial specification:  has a precondition
  - total specification:  has NO precondition

- how to turn a partial into a total specification?
  //partial spec
  sqrt(x):
     precondition: x >= 0
     postcondition:  y*y == x (-/+ epsilon)

  //total spec
  sqrt(x):
     precondition: 
     postcondition:
         //if x < 0:  raise exception
         //ow.  y*y == x (-/+ epsilon)

  //div_xy(x,y):   output = x/y
  partial spec:
   precond:  y != 0
   post :   y*output == x

  total spec:
    precond: true
    postcondition:   if y is 0, raise exception(DivByZero);
    y*output = 



list = null,  NPE
list = [], IOBE
list = [1], []  *
list = [1,2,3] , [2,3] *

pre: non-empty list and non-null
post: remove the head, return the rest (tail)

//total
pre: 
post:
if  (list is []) throw IOBE
if (list is null) throw NPE
remove the head, return the rest (tail)

specification too specific to implentation (remove(0)), to fix: throws IAE instead of IOBE when list is []

What does it mean to write correct software?
- It conforms to some expectation (software contracts or specificaions)
- Should pass its testsuite  ..
- Should not have exception or performance issues


- Specifications/contracts (requirements)
- Should not have exception or error

- Performance, maintainable, expandable :  desired qualities , but not
required for *correctness*


f (x, y):   // return output = x  / y
   //precond:  x,y are reals

  if y == 0:  raise exception
  ...



preconditions
- x,y are reals
- y != 0
- x >= 0
- x >=  100
- we want preconditions are are as WEAK as possible
   1. x could be any real numbers
   2. x must be non-negative
   3. x must be >= 100

3 is stronger than 2 is stronger 1
the best precondition is the weakest one, i.e., TRUE  (the function
has no assumption on the input)


- output : number
- output ~   x /y    (output * y   ~= x)

- precondition/requirements:  a condition over the inputs ,
assumptions that we make when the function starts
   - x,y being real numbers
   - y != 0

- postcondition/behaviors:  behavior of the function (the program),
relationshp btw inputs and outputs

   1. output is a number (reals,... )     weaker
   2. output * y ~= x                     stronger

   the best postcondition is the strongest one,  i.e.,   output * y ~= x

- side-effects:
   - can change input X, ....


task: sorting a list of numbers in ascending order  (e.g., 1,5,10,...)

g(l):
  //precondition: a list of numbers
  //same data types (comparable)
  //iterable ...
  //finite

  // l is arraylist of integers
  // precondition over l:   none,  true

   postcondition:
   - |l| == |l'|
   - l' same datatype  as l
   - [1,2,1,2]   [1,1,1,2]
   - l' is a permutation of l
   - l' ascending order


 //sort l in ascending order
 return l'




type checking

- void f (int x, int y){
   int o = 3;
   return o;
}

- type-checker is light-weight analysis and therefore can be built in in comilers,  just check if x and y are integers 
- assertion checking is heavy-weight because we can check expressive properties such as y = x ** 2; never built in, have to do some serious program analysis for this.
assertion(y = x**2);
