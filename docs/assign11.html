You have a choice of possible assignments:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Consider one of the <code>copyOf()</code> methods in the Java <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html">Arrays</a> utility class. Bloch uses this method in his <code>Stack</code> example. Code a corresponding method in C++, changing the argument list as necessary. Provide a specification for the C++ code by translating the JavaDoc and adding preconditions as necessary. Explain what this exercise demonstrates about C++ type safety.</li>

<li><p>
For most of the semester, we have focused on design considerations for constructing software that does something we want it to do. For this last assignment, I would like students to appreciate just how vulnerable software is to malicious parties intent on attacking their software.
</p>

<p>
There are two attacks documented in Bloch's Item 88: <i>Write <code>readObject()</code> methods defensively</i>. One is called <code>BogusPeriod</code>, and the other is called <code>MutablePeriod</code>. Implement either (your choice) of these attacks (basically involves typing in code from Bloch) and verify that the attack takes place.
</p></li>

<li>A different source of security vulnerabilities in Java also involve serialization. Bloch (and others) recommend "cross-platform structured data representations" (e.g. JSON or Protocol Buffers) as safe alternatives. Develop a simple serialization example in Java and convert it into a safe alternative (probably, JSON is easier to use, since it is text-based). To make the example more interesting, use some objects types that are not directly supported.</li>

<li>Find some existing (Java) code that uses the "int enum pattern" and refactor it to use Java <code>Enums</code> instead. Identify any type-safety issue you uncover in the existing code. To make the exercise interesting, extend your enums beyond simple named-constants in one of the ways discussed by Bloch in Item 34.</li>

<li>Where appropriate, code up, as JUnit theories, constraints for classes that implement the Java <code>Comparable</code> interface. Note that there is significant overlap with the in-class exercise. Note also that the Comparable interface is generic; hence, you should use generics in your JUnit test class.</li>

<li>Gain experience with one of the property-based testing tools. I suggest a Java-based one (such as <a href="https://jqwik.net">jqwik</a>). One way to do this is work through one of the articles linked on the jqwik site.</li>

In each case, the deliverable is a story. Write a brief report, and include enough evidence (output, screen shots, etc.) that the GTA can figure out that you actually completed the assignment.
