* Instructions
  Oral Assessment 1 will revisit the example from In-Class Exercise 0. I'll ask you about the *first* of the two given =equals()= methods, as well as "corner" cases where this method might do something odd.

  This won't be a deep-dive; that comes later. But you should be able to identify specific inputs that lead to corner case behavior. You should be able to assess code behavior on specific inputs.
