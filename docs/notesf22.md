Sorting (quicksort)
- Input: a list of integers numbers   [2,1,5,10]

- Output:  
 - output sorted in ascending order (smallest to largest)
 - O[i] <= O[j] where i < j
 - same types as inputs
 - only contains input elements 
 - *output is a permutation of input* and *output is in sored sorder (e.g., ascending)*
 

- Alg:
  - will do quicksort (pivot, n^2, amortized n log n)
  - 
  



input: [2,1,5,10]

output: [1,2,5,10]

[1,2,5,10,10,10]




Software Specifications (e.g., specification of a program/methoad/function)
 - Properties of the Inputs: preconditions
 
 - Properties of the Outputs:  postconditions
   - Typically will have some relationships with the inputs
   - Additiohnal properties ...
   
- Additional desirable properties/specifications that are common for all software
  - secured
  - robust
  - does not run out of memory
  - efficiently
  

specification of a program: precondition + postcondition


Then my implementation/program/method is correct wrt the given specification

```
int intdiv(int x, int y):
  /*
  input: x and y are integers, y cannot be zero
  output: z = x // y
  */
  

  return z
```
