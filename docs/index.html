<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
To give the students a solid understanding of modern software construction. To encourage the construction of software systems of high quality. In-depth study of software construction in a modern language including program specifications and OO designs. Concepts such as information hiding, data abstraction, and object-based and object-oriented software construction are discussed and illustrated. This course is part of the core of the SWE program.

<p>
<b>Note</b>: We'll start with Liskov. Don't worry about the publication date; Liskov is basically a math book, and hence ages remarkably well. We're interested in contracts, mutability, data abstraction, and type abstraction. Bloch is concerned about the same things, but explores them in more detail and in more up-to-date Java. Bloch also corrects some important points that weren't well understood when Liskov's text came out.

<h3 id="org4a7591b"><span class="section-number-3">3.3.</span> Weekly Schedule</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
This class is a group-based, <i>in-person</i> offering. You need to be present in class at class time. You will also need to schedule regular meetings with your group.
</p>

<p>
Each week will cover a topic, which is a small number of related technical issues (see course <a href="./schedule.html">schedule</a>). Each topic will follow roughly the same sequence of preparation, in-class learning activities, homework completion and (possibly) presentation, and knowledge assessment. Many of these activities will be group based. The sequence is:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Preparation: Complete assigned readings and watch relevant videos, if any.  No formal submission for this activity.</li>
<li>Reading Reflection: This is a formal opportunity for each group to reflect on the reading.</li>
<li>Class Meeting:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Combined session on the day's topic, followed by in-class exercises (group breakouts)</li>
<li>Break</li>
<li>Combined session on the day's topic, may followed by in-class exercises (group breakouts)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Homework (group-based)</li>
<li>Assessments via quiz: takes place at the <b>end</b> of class the same day as the homework is due.</li>

<h4 id="org02c3ac5"><span class="section-number-4">3.4.2.</span> Group Functioning</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-4-2">
<p>
Every student needs to be part of a group. I would prefer that groups stay stable throughout the semester, but if there is a good rationale to reconfigure a group or two, we'll do that.
</p>

<p>
<b>Group size</b>: 2 to 4 students.
</p>

<p>
Group creation mechanism: As a default, we'll drop students into groups at random. If you prefer a different group, during the first week you will have the option to re-group. If your group dwindles to just yourself, you'll need to join another group.
</p>

<p>
During the final exam, each individual will provide an assessment of the rest of their group. This assessment will determine the "Group Functioning" part of the grade.
</p>

<p>
Groups can communicate internally through any mechanism they choose: in-person, zoom, discord, google docs, etc.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org49d5c95" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org49d5c95"><span class="section-number-4">3.4.3.</span> Reading Reflections</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-4-3">
<p>
Each week, each group must complete a "reading reflection" the day <b>before</b> class. (That means midnight Sunday, in the case of this class, since class meetings are Monday afternoon.) I will review these assessments before class and use them to tune the in-class activities. Reading reflections are linked from the course schedule and must be turned in on BB. These reflections are part of the learning process rather than the assessment process. That is, they don't assess whether you have achieved mastery of the new material, rather they check whether you have done the necessary preparation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Important</b>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There are no make-ups.</li>
<li>Only one submission per <b>group</b>. Everyone in the group gets the same credit.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1e880ed" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org1e880ed"><span class="section-number-4">3.4.4.</span> Homework Assignments</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-4-4">
<p>
There are weekly <b>group</b> homework assighments. I post homework assignments on the class <a href="./schedule.html">schedule web site</a>. Your group will submit assignments via BB.
</p>

<p>
Because of the way in which this class is taught, it is important to stay on pace. Homeworks are due <b>before class</b>. Late submissions are not accepted except in truly exceptional circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<b>Important</b>: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Each group should be prepared to present their homework solution in class.</li>
<li><b>Statement of who did what</b>. Homeworks are group exercises. Each submission must contain a specific statement of who did what.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4548083" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4548083"><span class="section-number-4">3.4.5.</span> Weekly Quizzes</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-4-5">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Each quiz happens during the last 15-20 minutes of class.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Make-up Policy</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>All quizzes count towards the final grade. Each quiz is scored on a 10 point scale. Missed quizzes score 0/10. Students who miss a quiz or perform badly on a quiz may choose to take the "make-up".</li>
<li>The maximum possible score on the make-up is 8/10. (Example: your quiz grade is 5/10. You take the make-up and correctly answer 9 of 10 equally weighted questions. Your final score improves from 5/10 to 8/10.)</li>
<li>If you attempt the make-up, that score counts, no matter what your score was on the quiz. (Example: your quiz grade is 7/10. You take the make-up and correctly answer 5 of 10 equally weighted questions. Your final score declines from 7/10 to 5/10.)</li>
<li>Scheduling: the GTA will offer the make-up during TA office hours. The make-up can be different than the quiz given in class, but focuses on the same topics.</li>
<li>The make-up must be taken promptly and within a window of two class meetings from the quiz. (Example: Quiz 1 takes place on Wednesday, September 1. The make-up must be taken on or before Wednesday, September 15. Another Example: Quiz 11 takes place on Wednesday, November 11. Because we don't meet the week of Thanksgiving, the make-up must be taken on or before Wednesday, December 1.)</li>
<li>Each quiz only has one make-up, and you can only attempt that make-up once. However, you are free to use the make-up mechanism on as many different quizzes as you wish.</li>
<li>Quizzes are generally returned one week after the quiz is taken. Make-ups are returned after the window has closed.</li>
</ul>
