<p>
To give the students a solid understanding of modern software construction. To prepare students to construct sequential and concurrent programs. To encourage the construction of software systems of high quality. In-depth study of software construction in a modern language including control structuring and packaging. Concepts such as information hiding, data abstraction, and object-based and object-oriented software construction are discussed and illustrated. This course is part of the core of the SWE program. This section of 619 uses Java.

<p>
<b>Note</b>: We'll start with Liskov. Don't worry about the publication date; Liskov is basically a math book, and hence ages remarkably well. We're interested in contracts, mutability, data abstraction, and type abstraction. Bloch is concerned about the same things, but explores them in more detail and in more up-to-date Java. Bloch also corrects some important points that weren't well understood when Liskov's text came out.

<h2 id="orgbbc89be"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Weekly Schedule</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
This class is a group-based, online offering. That means you need to be present in class at class time. You will also need to schedule regular meetings with your group and with me (and possibly the GTA) outside of class.
</p>

<p>
Each week will cover a small number of related technical issues (see course <a href="./schedule.html">schedule</a>). Let's call this small number of technical issues a "topic". Each topic will follow roughly the same sequence of preparation, in-class learning activities, homework completion and (possibly) presentation, and knowledge assessment. To make this scale in an online environment, many of these activities will be group based. The sequence is:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Preparation: Complete assigned readings and watch relevant videos, if any.</li>
<li>Reading Reflection: This is a formal opportunity for each group to reflect on the reading.</li>
<li>Synchronous Class Meeting (BB Collaborate):
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Prior week's homework solution presentation and discussion. This is typically a randomly selected group, but occasionally, I'll do the presentation.</li>
<li>Reading reflection summary</li>
<li>Combined session on the day's topic, followed by in-class exercises (group breakouts)</li>
<li>Break</li>
<li>Combined session on the day's topic, followed by in-class exercises (group breakouts)</li>
<li>Wrap up</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Homework (group-based).</li>
<li>Individual oral assessments.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="org7287de1"><span class="section-number-3">5.1</span> Group Functioning</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
Every student needs to be part of a group. I would prefer that groups stay stable throughout the semester, but if there is a good rationale to reconfigure a group or two, we'll do that.
</p>

<p>
<b>Group size</b>: 2 to 4 students.
</p>

<p>
Group creation mechanism: As a default, we'll drop students into groups at random. If you are happy with your random group, great! If you prefer a different group, during the first week you will have the option to re-group. If your group dwindles to just yourself, you'll need to join another group.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the semester, each individual will provide an assessment of the rest of their group. This assessment will determine the "Group Functioning" part of the grade.
</p>

<p>
Groups can communicate internally through any mechanism they choose: zoom, discord, google docs, etc
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4b45401" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4b45401"><span class="section-number-3">5.2</span> Reading Reflections</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
Each week, each group must complete a "reading reflection" the day <b>before</b> class. (That means midnight Sunday, in the case of this class, since class meetings are Monday afternoon.) I will review these assessments before class, compile the overall responses, and use them to tune the in-class activities. Reading reflections are linked from the course schedule and must be turned in on BB. These reflections are part of the learning process rather than the assessment process. That is, they don't assess whether you have achieved mastery of the new material, rather they check whether you have done the necessary preparation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Important</b>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There are no make-ups.</li>
<li>Only one submission per <b>group</b>. Everyone in the group gets the same credit.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2a2e1fb" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2a2e1fb"><span class="section-number-3">5.3</span> Homework Assignments</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-3">
<p>
There are weekly <b>group</b> homework assighments. I post homework assignments on the class <a href="./schedule.html">schedule web site</a>. Generally, your group should submit assignments via BB.
</p>

<p>
Because of the way in which this class is taught, it is important to stay on pace. Homeworks are due <b>before class</b>. Late submissions are not accepted except in truly exceptional circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<b>Important</b>: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Each group should be prepared to present their homework solution in class.</li>
<li><b>Statement of who did what</b>. Homeworks are group exercises. Each submission must contain a specific statement of who did what.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd1f1586" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd1f1586"><span class="section-number-3">5.4</span> Assessments</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-4">
<p>
Ideally, oral assessments should happen every week. But I don't have the bandwidth to make that happen. Instead, every student will schedule an oral assessment once every <b>two</b> weeks.
</p>

<p>
<b>Process</b>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Scheduling: While each student will complete each assessment individually, we will schedule assessments by group. Students in odd numbered gropus should schedule themselves for an assessment in weeks with odd-numbered oral assessment guides. Students in even numbered groups should schedule themselves for an assessment in weeks with even-numbered oral assessment guides.</li>
<li>Duration: Each assessment lasts 10 minutes. This is a little tight, but generally works.</li>
<li>I will be forthcoming and concrete about the content for each assessment. I'll do this in the form of "Oral Assessment Guides" posted to the course schedule. That is, you shouldn't be surprised by any of the questions. Often, they will be closely related to the prior week's homework. The questions will typically look like, "What would Liskov (or Bloch) think of the following variation(s) of this snippet of code we studied last week? And why would they think that?"</li>
<li>Not every student will get the same quiz, even if the quiz is on the same day.</li>
<li><p>
The evaluation scale is as follows:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Awesome means you demonstrate mastery of the material. Scores 10/10.</li>
<li>Strong performance, but perhaps a slight wobble: Scores 9/10.</li>
<li>Acceptable, but some significant errors: Scores 8/10.</li>
<li>Weak: Scores 5/10 to 7/10.</li>
<li>Unacceptable: Scores 0/10.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Make-ups. The goal is to get you to understand the material. So, if you score as "Weak" or "Unacceptable", I'll give you an opportunity for a make-up. The maximum score on a make-up is 8/10. Before I'll admit you for a make-up, you will have to practice with the GTA. If the GTA gives me the green light, I'll schedule a make-up.

As with all GMU courses, SWE 619 is governed by the <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code/">GMU Honor Code</a>. In this course, all oral assessments and the final exam carry with them an implicit statement that it is the sole work of the author. Further, all group submissions require a statement of participation from each member of the group.
