* Quiz 3:

** Immutatiblity

  Consider a partial version of Bloch's mutable Stack class:
  #+begin_src java
    public class Stack {

        private Object[] elements;
        private int size = 0;

        public Stack() { this.elements = new Object[0]; }

        public void push (Object e) {
            ensureCapacity();      // implementation omitted from quiz
            elements[size++] = e;
        }

        public Object pop () {
            if (size == 0) throw new IllegalStateException("Stack.pop");
            Object result = elements[--size];
            elements[size] = null;
            return result;
        }
    }

  #+end_src
  Also consider the following client interaction with Stack
  #+begin_src java
    Stack s = new Stack();
    s.push("cat");
    s.push("dog");
    System.out.println(s.pop());

  #+end_src
  - What methods would be needed to convert the client interaction into an equivalent interaction with an immutable version called IStack? For each method, give *just the method header* - not the contract or implemetation. 

** Verification using Hoare Logic
  Given the program
   #+begin_src java
     // {x <= 10}   # P  
     while (x != 10){
       x := x + 1;
     }
     //{x == 10}  # Q
   #+end_src
  
  1. Informally reason that this program is correct with the given =P= and =Q=.
  1. Find a loop invariant and program that the program is correct (show your work, i.e., generate the =wp= and the =vc= of the program, and reason about these)
