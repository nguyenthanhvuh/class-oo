* Goals: Favoring composition over inheritance. Bloch, Item 18.

  Consider the =InstrumentedSet= example from Bloch Item 18 (as well as in-class exercise [[./inclass10A.html][#10A]]).
    1. Replace =Set= with =List=. There is no problem with =equals()=. Why not?
    1. Replace =Set= with =Collection=. Now =equals()= does not satisfy its contract.
      - Explain why there is a problem.
      - Demonstrate the problem with a suitable JUnit test.



  
* Grading Criteria
  The GTA will look for correct responses, appropriate JUnit tests, and plausible explanations when doing the grading.
