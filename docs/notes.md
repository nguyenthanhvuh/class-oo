```
def div(a:Float, b:Float) -> Float:
    
    return the result of a/b
    
    
    Precondition (Requires): b has to be non-zero
    Postcondition (Effects): c = a/b  :   c*b  + r = a
    
    ...
    

    return c

```


```
def sort(inputs):

pre: 
- inputs should have comparable types

post:
- outputs is a permutation of input
- sorted (ascending)


outputs

... 

```



- 4 scenarios: 
  - pre is statisfied, post is satisfied :   OK 
  - pre is satisfied, post is not :    WRONG
  - pre is not satisfied, post is not satisfied:   OK 
  - pre is not satisfied, post is satisfied: OK
