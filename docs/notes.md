## Data Abstraction

*Motivation**: Data abstraction allows us to abstract from the *details of how data objects are implemented* to *how the objects behave*.


### Specs of Data Abstraction
- the representation of the data; e.g., using `vector` to represent `IntSet`, and `list of ints` (of terms) to represent `Poly`
- the constructors to initialize new objects (e.g., empty vector for `IntSet`)
- the methods define access and modification of the objects
